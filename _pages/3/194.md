##  Future Total Eclipses 

### Future Total Solar Eclipses

We also include eclipses that are _annular_—where the Moon is directly in front of the Sun, but doesn’t fully cover it—leaving a ring of light around the dark Moon’s edges)

### Footnotes

  - 1 Remember that a total or annular eclipse is only visible on a narrow track. The same eclipse will be partial over a much larger area, but partial eclipses are not as spectacular as total ones.
  - 2 This is a so-called hybrid eclipse, which is total in some places and annular in others.

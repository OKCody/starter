##  Astronomy Websites, Images, and Apps 

Throughout the textbook, we suggest useful resources for students on the specific topics in a given chapter. Here, we offer some websites for exploring astronomy in general, plus good sites for viewing and downloading the best astronomy images, and guides to astronomical apps for smartphones and tablets. This is not an exhaustive listing, but merely a series of suggestions to whet the appetite of those wanting to go beyond the textbook.

### Websites for Exploring Astronomy in General

#### Astronomical Organizations

Amateur Astronomy Clubs. In most large cities and a number of rural areas, there are _amateur astronomy clubs_, where those interested in the hobby of astronomy gather to observe the sky, share telescopes, hear speakers, and help educate the public about the night sky. To find an astronomy club near you, you can try the following sites:

  - Night Sky Network club finder: <http://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/club-map.cfm>.
  - _Sky & Telescope_ Magazine astronomy clubs and organizations: <http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/organizations>.
  - _Astronomy_ Magazine club finder: <http://www.astronomy.com/groups.aspx>.
  - Astronomical League astronomy clubs and societies: <http://www.astroleague.org/societies/all>.
  - Go-Astronomy club search: <http://www.go-astronomy.com/astro-club-search.htm>.

American Astronomical Society: [http://www.aas.org][1]. Composed mainly of professional astronomers. They have an active education office and various materials for students and the public on the education pages of their website.

Astronomical League: [http://www.astroleague.org][2]. The league is the umbrella organization of American astronomy clubs. They offer a newsletter, national observing programs, and support for how to form and support a club.

Astronomical Society of the Pacific: [http://www.astrosociety.org][3]. Founded in 1889, this international society is devoted to astronomy education and outreach. They have programs, publications, and materials for families, teachers, amateur astronomers, museum guides, and anyone interested in astronomy.

European Space Agency (ESA): <http://www.esa.int/>. Information on European space missions with an excellent gallery of images.

International Astronomical Union (IAU): <http://www.iau.org/>. International organization for professional astronomers; see the menu choice “IAU for the Public” for information on naming astronomical objects and other topics of interest to students.

International Dark-Sky Association: [http://www.darksky.org][4]. Dedicated to combating light pollution, the encroachment of stray light that wastes energy and washes out the glories of the night sky.

NASA: [http://www.nasa.gov][5]. NASA has a wide range of information on its many websites; the trick is to find what you need. Most space missions and NASA centers have their own sites.

Planetary Society: [http://www.planetary.org][6]. Founded by the late Carl Sagan and others, this group works to encourage planetary exploration and the search for life elsewhere. While much of their work is advocacy, they have some educational outreach too.

Royal Astronomical Society of Canada: <http://www.rasc.ca/>. Unites professional and amateur astronomers around Canada; has 28 centers with local activities, plus national magazines and meetings.

#### Some Astronomical Publications Students Can Read

_Astronomy Now_: <http://www.astronomynow.com/>. A colorful British monthly, with excellent articles about astronomy, the history of astronomy, and stargazing.

_Astronomy_: [http://www.astronomy.com][7]. Has the largest circulation of any magazine devoted to the universe and is designed especially for astronomy hobbyists and armchair astronomers.

_Free Astronomy_: <http://www.astropublishing.com/>. A new web-based publication, with European roots.

_Scientific American_: [http://www.sciam.com][8]. Offers one astronomy article about every other issue. These articles, a number of which are reproduced on their website, are at a slightly higher level_,_ but—often being written by the astronomers who have done the work—are authoritative and current.

_Sky & Telescope_: [http://skyandtelescope.com][9]. An older and somewhat higher-level magazine for astronomy hobbyists. Many noted astronomers write for this publication.

_Sky News_: <http://www.skynews.ca/>. A Canadian publication, featuring both astronomy and stargazing information. It also lists Canadian events for hobbyists.

_StarDate_: <https://stardate.org/>. Magazine that accompanies the brief radio program, with a useful website for beginners.

#### Sites that Cover Astronomy News

Exploring the Universe: [http://fraknoi.blogspot.com][10]. An astronomy news blog by one of the original authors of this textbook.

Portal to the Universe: <http://www.portaltotheuniverse.org/>. A site that gathers online astronomy and space news items, blogs, and pictures.

Science@NASA news stories and newscasts: <http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/>. Well-written stories with, of course, a NASA focus.

Space.com: <http://www.space.com/news/>. A commercial site, but with wide coverage of space and astronomy news.

Universe Today: <http://www.universetoday.com/>. Another commercial site, with good articles by science journalists, but a lot of ads.

#### Sites for Answering Astronomical Questions

Ask an Astrobiologist: <http://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ask-an-astrobiologist/>. On this site from the National Astrobiology Institute at NASA, astronomer David Morrison answered questions about the search for life on other planets, the origin of life on Earth, and many other topics.

Ask an Astronomer at Lick Observatory: <http://www.ucolick.org/~mountain/AAA/>. Graduate students and staff members at this California observatory answered selected astronomy questions, particularly from high school students.

A site from the California Institute of Technology, with an archive focusing on infrared (heat-ray) astronomy and the discoveries it makes about cool objects in the universe. No longer taking new questions.

Ask the Astronomer: <http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/qanda.html>. This site, run by astronomer Sten Odenwald, is no longer active, but lists 3001 answers to questions asked in the mid-1990s. They are nicely organized by topic.

##  The Brightest Twenty Stars 

Note: These are the stars that _appear_ the brightest visually, as seen from our vantage point on Earth. They are not necessarily the stars that are intrinsically the most luminous.

![A table titled “The Brightest Twenty Stars” with eleven columns and twenty-one rows. The first row is a header row and labels each column: “Traditional Name footnote: The brightest stars typically have names from antiquity. Next to each star’s ancient name, we have added a column with its name in the system originated by Bayer”, “Bayer Name”, “Luminosity \(Sun = 1\)”, “Distance \(light-year\) footnote: The distances of the more remote stars are estimated from their spectral types and apparent brightnesses and are only approximate. The luminosities for those stars are approximate to the same degree.”, “Spectral Type”, “Proper Motion: RA \(arcsec/y\)”, “Proper Motion: Dec \(arcsec/y\)”, “Right Ascension \(h\) footnote: Right ascension given for Epoch 2000.0”, “Right Ascension \(m\) footnote: Right ascension given for Epoch 2000.0”, “Declination \(deg\) footnote: Declination given for Epoch 2000.0”, “Declination \(min\) footnote: Declination given for Epoch 2000.0”.

Next to each star’s ancient name, we have added a column with its name in the system originated by Bayer (see the [Naming Stars][2] feature box.) The distances of the more remote stars are estimated from their spectral types and apparent brightnesses and are only approximate. The luminosities for those stars are approximate to the same degree. Right ascension and declination is given for Epoch 2000.0._

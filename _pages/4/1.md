##  Preface 

### Summary

Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science and allied health students. The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course. Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. The artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations. Color is used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration. Significant use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations, and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept. Finally, enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended careers. 

Welcome to _Anatomy and Physiology_, an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost.

### About _Anatomy and Physiology_

#### Coverage and Scope

The units of our _Anatomy and Physiology_ textbook adhere to the scope and sequence followed by most two-semester courses nationwide. The development choices for this textbook were made with the guidance of hundreds of faculty who are deeply involved in teaching this course. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology, career orientation, practical applications, and multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of increasing relevance to students. We strove to make the discipline meaningful and memorable to students, so that they can draw from it a working knowledge that will enrich their future studies. 

##### Unit 1: Levels of Organization 

Chapters 1–4 provide students with a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language, the levels of organization, and the basics of chemistry and cell biology. These chapters provide a foundation for the further study of the body. They also focus particularly on how the body’s regions, important chemicals, and cells maintain homeostasis.  
Chapter 1 An Introduction to the Human Body  
Chapter 2 The Chemical Level of Organization  
Chapter 3 The Cellular Level of Organization  
Chapter 4 The Tissue Level of Organization  


##### Unit 2: Support and Movement 

In Chapters 5–11, students explore the skin, the largest organ of the body, and examine the body’s skeletal and muscular systems, following a traditional sequence of topics. This unit is the first to walk students through specific systems of the body, and as it does so, it maintains a focus on homeostasis as well as those diseases and conditions that can disrupt it.  
Chapter 5 The Integumentary System  
Chapter 6 Bone and Skeletal Tissue  
Chapter 7 The Axial Skeleton  
Chapter 8 The Appendicular Skeleton  
Chapter 9 Joints  
Chapter 10 Muscle Tissue  
Chapter 11 The Muscular System  


##### Unit 3: Regulation, Integration, and Control

Chapters 12–17 help students answer questions about nervous and endocrine system control and regulation. In a break with the traditional sequence of topics, the special senses are integrated into the chapter on the somatic nervous system. The chapter on the neurological examination offers students a unique approach to understanding nervous system function using five simple but powerful diagnostic tests.   
Chapter 12 Introduction to the Nervous System  
Chapter 13 The Anatomy of the Nervous System  
Chapter 14 The Somatic Nervous System  
Chapter 15 The Autonomic Nervous System  
Chapter 16 The Neurological Exam  
Chapter 17 The Endocrine System  


##### Unit 4: Fluids and Transport 

In Chapters 18–21, students examine the principal means of transport for materials needed to support the human body, regulate its internal environment, and provide protection.   
Chapter 18 Blood  
Chapter 19 The Cardiovascular System: The Heart  
Chapter 20 The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels and Circulation  
Chapter 21 The Lymphatic System and Immunity 

##### Unit 5: Energy, Maintenance, and Environmental Exchange

In Chapters 22–26, students discover the interaction between body systems and the outside environment for the exchange of materials, the capture of energy, the release of waste, and the overall maintenance of the internal systems that regulate the exchange. The explanations and illustrations are particularly focused on how structure relates to function.   
Chapter 22 The Respiratory System  
Chapter 23 The Digestive System  
Chapter 24 Nutrition and Metabolism  
Chapter 25 The Urinary System  
Chapter 26 Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid–Base Balance  


##### Unit 6: Human Development and the Continuity of Life

The closing chapters examine the male and female reproductive systems, describe the process of human development and the different stages of pregnancy, and end with a review of the mechanisms of inheritance.   
Chapter 27 The Reproductive System  
Chapter 28 Development and Genetic Inheritance  


#### Pedagogical Foundation and Features

_Anatomy and Physiology_ is designed to promote scientific literacy. Throughout the text, you will find features that engage the students by taking selected topics a step further. 

  - **Homeostatic Imbalances** discusses the effects and results of imbalances in the body.
  - **Disorders** showcases a disorder that is relevant to the body system at hand. This feature may focus on a specific disorder or a set of related disorders.
  - **Diseases** showcases a disease that is relevant to the body system at hand.
  - **Aging** explores the effect aging has on a body’s system and specific disorders that manifest over time. 
  - **Career Connections** presents information on the various careers often pursued by allied health students, such as medical technician, medical examiner, and neurophysiologist. Students are introduced to the educational requirements for and day-to-day responsibilities in these careers.
  - **Everyday Connections** tie anatomical and physiological concepts to emerging issues and discuss these in terms of everyday life. Topics include “Anabolic Steroids” and “The Effect of Second-Hand Tobacco Smoke.”
  - **Interactive Links** direct students to online exercises, simulations, animations, and videos to add a fuller context to core content and help improve understanding of the material. Many features include links to the University of Michigan’s interactive WebScopes, which allow students to zoom in on micrographs in the collection. These resources were vetted by reviewers and other subject matter experts to ensure that they are effective and accurate. We strongly urge students to explore these links, whether viewing a video or inputting data into a simulation, to gain the fullest experience and to learn how to search for information independently. 

#### Dynamic, Learner-Centered Art

Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations. 

Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students’ attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).

##### Micrographs

Micrograph magnifications have been calculated based on the objective provided with the image. If a micrograph was recorded at 40×, and the image was magnified an additional 2×, we calculated the final magnification of the micrograph to be 80×. 

Please note that, when viewing the textbook electronically, the micrograph magnification provided in the text does not take into account the size and magnification of the screen on your electronic device. There may be some variation.

### Summary

#### 14.1 Fluids, Density, and Pressure

  - A fluid is a state of matter that yields to sideways or shearing forces. Liquids and gases are both fluids. Fluid statics is the physics of stationary fluids.
  - Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance or object, defined as ρ=m/V. The SI unit of density is kg/m3.
  - Pressure is the force per unit perpendicular area over which the force is applied, p=F/A. The SI unit of pressure is the pascal: 1Pa=1N/m2.
  - Pressure due to the weight of a liquid of constant density is given by p=ρgh, where _p_ is the pressure, _h_ is the depth of the liquid, ρ is the density of the liquid, and _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity.

#### 14.2 Measuring Pressure

  - Gauge pressure is the pressure relative to atmospheric pressure.
  - Absolute pressure is the sum of gauge pressure and atmospheric pressure.
  - Open-tube manometers have U-shaped tubes and one end is always open. They are used to measure pressure. A mercury barometer is a device that measures atmospheric pressure.
  - The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa), but several other units are commonly used.

#### 14.3 Pascal's Principle and Hydraulics

  - Pressure is force per unit area.
  - A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container.
  - A hydraulic system is an enclosed fluid system used to exert forces.

#### 14.4 Archimedes’ Principle and Buoyancy

  - Buoyant force is the net upward force on any object in any fluid. If the buoyant force is greater than the object’s weight, the object will rise to the surface and float. If the buoyant force is less than the object’s weight, the object will sink. If the buoyant force equals the object’s weight, the object can remain suspended at its present depth. The buoyant force is always present and acting on any object immersed either partially or entirely in a fluid.
  - Archimedes’ principle states that the buoyant force on an object equals the weight of the fluid it displaces.

#### 14.5 Fluid Dynamics

  - Flow rate _Q_ is defined as the volume _V_ flowing past a point in time _t_, or Q=dVdt where _V_ is volume and _t_ is time. The SI unit of flow rate is m3/s, but other rates can be used, such as L/min.
  - Flow rate and velocity are related by Q=Av where _A_ is the cross-sectional area of the flow and _v_ is its average velocity.
  - The equation of continuity states that for an incompressible fluid, the mass flowing into a pipe must equal the mass flowing out of the pipe.

#### 14.6 Bernoulli’s Equation

  - Bernoulli’s equation states that the sum on each side of the following equation is constant, or the same at any two points in an incompressible frictionless fluid:  
p1+12ρv21+ρgh1=p2+12ρv22+ρgh2.
  - Bernoulli’s principle is Bernoulli’s equation applied to situations in which the height of the fluid is constant. The terms involving depth (or height _h_) subtract out, yielding  
p1+12ρv21=p2+12ρv22.
  - Bernoulli’s principle has many applications, including entrainment and velocity measurement.

#### 14.7 Viscosity and Turbulence

  - Laminar flow is characterized by smooth flow of the fluid in layers that do not mix.
  - Turbulence is characterized by eddies and swirls that mix layers of fluid together.
  - Fluid viscosity η is due to friction within a fluid.
  - Flow is proportional to pressure difference and inversely proportional to resistance:  
Q=p−2p1R.
  - The pressure drop caused by flow and resistance is given by p2–.
  - The Reynolds number NRNR can reveal whether flow is laminar or turbulent. It is NR=2ρvrηNR=2ρvrη.
  - For NRNR below about 2000, flow is laminar. For NRNR above about 3000, flow is turbulent. For values of NRNR between 2000 and 3000, it may be either or both.

[93][62]. 

A spherical particle falling at a terminal speed in a liquid must have the gravitational force balanced by the drag force and the buoyant force. The buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid, while the drag force is assumed to be given by Stokes Law, Fs=6πrηv.Fs=6πrηv. Show that the terminal speed is given by v=2R2g9η(ρs−ρ1)v=2R2g9η(ρs−ρ1), where _R_ is the radius of the sphere, ρsρs is its density, and ρ1ρ1 is the density of the fluid, and ηη the coefficient of viscosity.

[95][63]. 

A skydiver will reach a terminal velocity when the air drag equals his or her weight. For a skydiver with a large body, turbulence is a factor at high speeds. The drag force then is approximately proportional to the square of the velocity. Taking the drag force to be FD=12ρAv2,FD=12ρAv2, and setting this equal to the skydiver’s weight, find the terminal speed for a person falling “spread eagle.”

The temperature of the atmosphere is not always constant and can increase or decrease with height. In a neutral atmosphere, where there is not a significant amount of vertical mixing, the temperature decreases at a rate of approximately 6.5 K per km. The magnitude of the decrease in temperature as height increases is known as the lapse rate (Γ).(Γ). (The symbol is the upper case Greek letter gamma.)

A frequently quoted rule of thumb in aircraft design is that wings should produce about 1000 N of lift per square meter of wing. (The fact that a wing has a top and bottom surface does not double its area.) (a) At takeoff, an aircraft travels at 60.0 m/s, so that the air speed relative to the bottom of the wing is 60.0 m/s. Given the sea level density of air as 1.29kg/m31.29kg/m3, how fast must it move over the upper surface to create the ideal lift? (b) How fast must air move over the upper surface at a cruising speed of 245 m/s and at an altitude where air density is one-fourth that at sea level? (Note that this is not all of the aircraft’s lift—some comes from the body of the plane, some from engine thrust, and so on. Furthermore, Bernoulli’s principle gives an approximate answer because flow over the wing creates turbulence.)

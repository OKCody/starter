### Key Terms

**banked curve** curve in a road that is sloping in a manner that helps a vehicle negotiate the curve 

**centripetal force** any net force causing uniform circular motion 

**Coriolis force** inertial force causing the apparent deflection of moving objects when viewed in a rotating frame of reference

### Summary

#### 6.1 Solving Problems with Newton’s Laws

  - Newton’s laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to solve motion problems.
  - Some problems contain multiple force vectors acting in different directions on an object. Be sure to draw diagrams, resolve all force vectors into horizontal and vertical components, and draw a free-body diagram. Always analyze the direction in which an object accelerates so that you can determine whether Fnet=maFnet=ma or Fnet=0.Fnet=0.
  - The normal force on an object is not always equal in magnitude to the weight of the object. If an object is accelerating vertically, the normal force is less than or greater than the weight of the object. Also, if the object is on an inclined plane, the normal force is always less than the full weight of the object.
  - Some problems contain several physical quantities, such as forces, acceleration, velocity, or position. You can apply concepts from kinematics and dynamics to solve these problems.

#### 6.2 Friction

  - Friction is a contact force that opposes the motion or attempted motion between two systems. Simple friction is proportional to the normal force _N_ supporting the two systems.
  - The magnitude of static friction force between two materials stationary relative to each other is determined using the coefficient of static friction, which depends on both materials.
  - The kinetic friction force between two materials moving relative to each other is determined using the coefficient of kinetic friction, which also depends on both materials and is always less than the coefficient of static friction.

#### 6.3 Centripetal Force

  - Centripetal force F→cF→c is a “center-seeking” force that always points toward the center of rotation. It is perpendicular to linear velocity and has the magnitude  
Fc=mac.Fc=mac.
  - Rotating and accelerated frames of reference are noninertial. Inertial forces, such as the Coriolis force, are needed to explain motion in such frames.

#### 6.4 Drag Force and Terminal Speed

  - Drag forces acting on an object moving in a fluid oppose the motion. For larger objects (such as a baseball) moving at a velocity in air, the drag force is determined using the drag coefficient (typical values are given in [Table 6.2][1]), the area of the object facing the fluid, and the fluid density.
  - For small objects (such as a bacterium) moving in a denser medium (such as water), the drag force is given by Stokes’ law.

Many amusement parks have rides that make vertical loops like the one shown below. For safety, the cars are attached to the rails in such a way that they cannot fall off.

Suppose a mass is moving in a circular path on a frictionless table as shown below. In Earth’s frame of reference, there is no centrifugal force pulling the mass away from the center of rotation, yet there is a force stretching the string attaching the mass to the nail.

When a toilet is flushed or a sink is drained, the water (and other material) begins to rotate about the drain on the way down. Assuming no initial rotation and a flow initially directly straight toward the drain, explain what causes the rotation and which direction it has in the Northern Hemisphere.

Explain in an inertial frame of reference (Earth is nearly one) what pins the riders to the wall, and identify all forces acting on them.

A freight train consists of two 8.00×105-kg8.00×105-kg engines and 45 cars with average masses of 5.50×105kg.5.50×105kg.

The following forces are indicated: f sub k 2 acting on M and pointing to the right, f sub k 1 acting on 3 M and pointing to the right, F acting on 3 M and pointing to the left, N sub 2 acting on M and pointing up, N sub 1 acting on 3 M and pointing up, M g acting on M and pointing down, , 3 M g acting on 3 M and pointing down.][96] 126\. 

Two blocks are stacked as shown below, and rest on a frictionless surface. There is friction between the two blocks (coefficient of friction μμ). An external force is applied to the top block at an angle θθ with the horizontal. What is the maximum force _F_ that can be applied for the two blocks to move together?

![Rectangular block M sub 2 is on a horizontal surface. Rectangular block M sub 1 is on top of block M sub 2. A force F pushes on block M sub 1. Force F is directed down and to the right, at a angle theta to the horizontal.][97] [127][98]. 

A box rests on the (horizontal) back of a truck. The coefficient of static friction between the box and the surface on which it rests is 0.24. What maximum distance can the truck travel (starting from rest and moving horizontally with constant acceleration) in 3.0 s without having the box slide?

128\. 

A double-incline plane is shown below. The coefficient of friction on the left surface is 0.30, and on the right surface 0.16. Calculate the acceleration of the system.

![Two carts connected by a string passing over a pulley are on either side of a double inclined plane. The string passes over a pulley attached to the top of the double incline. On the left, the incline makes an angle of 37 degrees with the horizontal and the cart on that side has mass 10 kilograms. On the right, the incline makes an angle of 53 degrees with the horizontal and the cart on that side has mass 15 kilograms.][99]

### Challenge Problems

[129][100]. 

In a later chapter, you will find that the weight of a particle varies with altitude such that w=mgr02r2w=mgr02r2 where r0r0 is the radius of Earth and _r_ is the distance from Earth’s center. If the particle is fired vertically with velocity v0v0 from Earth’s surface, determine its velocity as a function of position _r_. (_Hint:_ use adr=vdv,adr=vdv, the rearrangement mentioned in the text.)

130\. 

A large centrifuge, like the one shown below, is used to expose aspiring astronauts to accelerations similar to those experienced in rocket launches and atmospheric reentries. (a) At what angular velocity is the centripetal acceleration 10_g_ if the rider is 15.0 m from the center of rotation? (b) The rider’s cage hangs on a pivot at the end of the arm, allowing it to swing outward during rotation as shown in the bottom accompanying figure. At what angle θθ below the horizontal will the cage hang when the centripetal acceleration is 10_g_? (_Hint:_ The arm supplies centripetal force and supports the weight of the cage. Draw a free-body diagram of the forces to see what the angle θθ should be.)

![\(a\) A photograph of a high g training centrifuge. The astronaut sits in a cage at the end of a long arm that rotates in a horizontal plane. \(b\) An illustration of a top view of the centrifuge along with an illustration of the forces. The free body diagram shows the weight, w, pointing vertically down and the force F sub arm pointing up and to the left. The forces are then shown rearranged to form a right triangle. F sub arm is the hypotenuse of the triangle pointing up and left, w is the vertical side pointing down, and F sub c is the base pointing to the left. The F sub c arrow is then shown separately with the notation that vector F sub c equals F sub net.][101] [131][102]. 

A car of mass 1000.0 kg is traveling along a level road at 100.0 km/h when its brakes are applied. Calculate the stopping distance if the coefficient of kinetic friction of the tires is 0.500. Neglect air resistance. (_Hint:_ since the distance traveled is of interest rather than the time, _x_ is the desired independent variable and not _t_. Use the Chain Rule to change the variable: dvdt=dvdxdxdt=vdvdx.)dvdt=dvdxdxdt=vdvdx.)

132\. 

An airplane flying at 200.0 m/s makes a turn that takes 4.0 min. What bank angle is required? What is the percentage increase in the perceived weight of the passengers?

[133][103]. 

A skydiver is at an altitude of 1520 m. After 10.0 seconds of free fall, he opens his parachute and finds that the air resistance, FDFD, is given by the formula FD=−bv,FD=−bv, where _b_ is a constant and _v_ is the velocity. If b=0.750,b=0.750, and the mass of the skydiver is 82.0 kg, first set up differential equations for the velocity and the position, and then find: (a) the speed of the skydiver when the parachute opens, (b) the distance fallen before the parachute opens, (c) the terminal velocity after the parachute opens (find the limiting velocity), and (d) the time the skydiver is in the air after the parachute opens.

134\. 

In a television commercial, a small, spherical bead of mass 4.00 g is released from rest at t=0t=0 in a bottle of liquid shampoo. The terminal speed is observed to be 2.00 cm/s. Find (a) the value of the constant _b_ in the equation v=mgb(1−e−bt/m),v=mgb(1−e−bt/m), and (b) the value of the resistive force when the bead reaches terminal speed.

[135][104]. 

A boater and motor boat are at rest on a lake. Together, they have mass 200.0 kg. If the thrust of the motor is a constant force of 40.0 N in the direction of motion, and if the resistive force of the water is numerically equivalent to 2 times the speed _v_ of the boat, set up and solve the differential equation to find: (a) the velocity of the boat at time _t_; (b) the limiting velocity (the velocity after a long time has passed).

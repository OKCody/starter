## Chapter Review

### Key Terms

**action-at-a-distance force** type of force exerted without physical contact 

**aphelion** farthest point from the Sun of an orbiting body; the corresponding term for the Moon’s farthest point from Earth is the apogee 

**apparent weight** reading of the weight of an object on a scale that does not account for acceleration 

**black hole** mass that becomes so dense, that it collapses in on itself, creating a singularity at the center surround by an event horizon 

**escape velocity** initial velocity an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of another; it is more accurately defined as the velocity of an object with zero total mechanical energy 

**event horizon** location of the Schwarzschild radius and is the location near a black hole from within which no object, even light, can escape 

**gravitational field** vector field that surrounds the mass creating the field; the field is represented by field lines, in which the direction of the field is tangent to the lines, and the magnitude (or field strength) is inversely proportional to the spacing of the lines; other masses respond to this field 

**gravitationally bound** two object are gravitationally bound if their orbits are closed; gravitationally bound systems have a negative total mechanical energy 

**Kepler’s first law** law stating that every planet moves along an ellipse, with the Sun located at a focus of the ellipse 

**Kepler’s second law** law stating that a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times, meaning it has a constant areal velocity 

**Kepler’s third law** law stating that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit 

**neap tide** low tide created when the Moon and the Sun form a right triangle with Earth 

**neutron star** most compact object known—outside of a black hole itself 

**Newton’s law of gravitation** every mass attracts every other mass with a force proportional to the product of their masses, inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, and with direction along the line connecting the center of mass of each 

**non-Euclidean geometry** geometry of curved space, describing the relationships among angles and lines on the surface of a sphere, hyperboloid, etc. 

**orbital period** time required for a satellite to complete one orbit 

**orbital speed** speed of a satellite in a circular orbit; it can be also be used for the instantaneous speed for noncircular orbits in which the speed is not constant 

**perihelion** point of closest approach to the Sun of an orbiting body; the corresponding term for the Moon’s closest approach to Earth is the perigee 

**principle of equivalence** part of the general theory of relativity, it states that there no difference between free fall and being weightless, or a uniform gravitational field and uniform acceleration 

**Schwarzschild radius** critical radius (RS) such that if a mass were compressed to the extent that its radius becomes less than the Schwarzschild radius, then the mass will collapse to a singularity, and anything that passes inside that radius cannot escape 

**space-time** concept of space-time is that time is essentially another coordinate that is treated the same way as any individual spatial coordinate; in the equations that represent both special and general relativity, time appears in the same context as do the spatial coordinates 

**spring tide** high tide created when the Moon, the Sun, and Earth are along one line 

**theory of general relativity** Einstein’s theory for gravitation and accelerated reference frames; in this theory, gravitation is the result of mass and energy distorting the space-time around it; it is also often referred to as Einstein’s theory of gravity 

**tidal force** _difference_ between the gravitational force at the center of a body and that at any other location on the body; the tidal force stretches the body 

**universal gravitational constant** constant representing the strength of the gravitational force, that is believed to be the same throughout the universe

### Summary

#### 13.1 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

  - All masses attract one another with a gravitational force proportional to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
  - Spherically symmetrical masses can be treated as if all their mass were located at the center.
  - Nonsymmetrical objects can be treated as if their mass were concentrated at their center of mass, provided their distance from other masses is large compared to their size.

#### 13.2 Gravitation Near Earth's Surface

  - The weight of an object is the gravitational attraction between Earth and the object.
  - The gravitational field is represented as lines that indicate the direction of the gravitational force; the line spacing indicates the strength of the field.
  - Apparent weight differs from actual weight due to the acceleration of the object.

#### 13.3 Gravitational Potential Energy and Total Energy

  - The acceleration due to gravity changes as we move away from Earth, and the expression for gravitational potential energy must reflect this change.
  - The total energy of a system is the sum of kinetic and gravitational potential energy, and this total energy is conserved in orbital motion.
  - Objects must have a minimum velocity, the escape velocity, to leave a planet and not return.
  - Objects with total energy less than zero are bound; those with zero or greater are unbounded.

#### 13.4 Satellite Orbits and Energy

  - Orbital velocities are determined by the mass of the body being orbited and the distance from the center of that body, and not by the mass of a much smaller orbiting object.
  - The period of the orbit is likewise independent of the orbiting object’s mass.
  - Bodies of comparable masses orbit about their common center of mass and their velocities and periods should be determined from Newton’s second law and law of gravitation.

#### 13.5 Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

  - All orbital motion follows the path of a conic section. Bound or closed orbits are either a circle or an ellipse; unbounded or open orbits are either a parabola or a hyperbola.
  - The areal velocity of any orbit is constant, a reflection of the conservation of angular momentum.
  - The square of the period of an elliptical orbit is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of that orbit.

#### 13.6 Tidal Forces

  - Earth’s tides are caused by the difference in gravitational forces from the Moon and the Sun on the different sides of Earth.
  - Spring or neap (high) tides occur when Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned, and neap or (low) tides occur when they form a right triangle.
  - Tidal forces can create internal heating, changes in orbital motion, and even destruction of orbiting bodies.

#### 13.7 Einstein's Theory of Gravity

  - According to the theory of general relativity, gravity is the result of distortions in space-time created by mass and energy.
  - The principle of equivalence states that that both mass and acceleration distort space-time and are indistinguishable in comparable circumstances.
  - Black holes, the result of gravitational collapse, are singularities with an event horizon that is proportional to their mass.
  - Evidence for the existence of black holes is still circumstantial, but the amount of that evidence is overwhelming.

### Conceptual Questions

#### 13.1 Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

[1][1]. 

Action at a distance, such as is the case for gravity, was once thought to be illogical and therefore untrue. What is the ultimate determinant of the truth in science, and why was this action at a distance ultimately accepted?

2\. 

In the law of universal gravitation, Newton assumed that the force was proportional to the product of the two masses (~m1m2). While all scientific conjectures must be experimentally verified, can you provide arguments as to why this must be? (You may wish to consider simple examples in which any other form would lead to contradictory results.)

#### 13.2 Gravitation Near Earth's Surface

[3][2]. 

Must engineers take Earth’s rotation into account when constructing very tall buildings at any location other than the equator or very near the poles?

#### 13.3 Gravitational Potential Energy and Total Energy

4\. 

It was stated that a satellite with negative total energy is in a bound orbit, whereas one with zero or positive total energy is in an unbounded orbit. Why is this true? What choice for gravitational potential energy was made such that this is true?

[5][3]. 

It was shown that the energy required to lift a satellite into a _low_ Earth orbit (the change in potential energy) is only a small fraction of the kinetic energy needed to keep it in orbit. Is this true for larger orbits? Is there a trend to the ratio of kinetic energy to change in potential energy as the size of the orbit increases?

#### 13.4 Satellite Orbits and Energy

6\. 

One student argues that a satellite in orbit is in free fall because the satellite keeps falling toward Earth. Another says a satellite in orbit is not in free fall because the acceleration due to gravity is not 9.80m/s2. With whom do you agree with and why?

[7][4]. 

Many satellites are placed in geosynchronous orbits. What is special about these orbits? For a global communication network, how many of these satellites would be needed?

#### 13.5 Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion

8\. 

Are Kepler’s laws purely descriptive, or do they contain causal information?

[9][5]. 

In the diagram below for a satellite in an elliptical orbit about a much larger mass, indicate where its speed is the greatest and where it is the least. What conservation law dictates this behavior? Indicate the directions of the force, acceleration, and velocity at these points. Draw vectors for these same three quantities at the two points where the _y_-axis intersects (along the semi-minor axis) and from this determine whether the speed is increasing decreasing, or at a max/min.

![A diagram showing an x y coordinate system and an ellipse, centered on the origin with foci on the x axis. The focus on the left is labeled f 1 and M. The focus on the right is labeled f 2. A location labeled as m is shown above f 2. The right triangle defined by f 1, f 2, and m is shown in red. The clockwise direction tangent to the ellipse is indicated by blue arrows.][6]

#### 13.6 Tidal Forces

10\. 

As an object falls into a black hole, tidal forces increase. Will these tidal forces always tear the object apart as it approaches the Schwarzschild radius? How does the mass of the black hole and size of the object affect your answer?

#### 13.7 Einstein's Theory of Gravity

[11][7]. 

The principle of equivalence states that all experiments done in a lab in a uniform gravitational field cannot be distinguished from those done in a lab that is not in a gravitational field but is uniformly accelerating. For the latter case, consider what happens to a laser beam at some height shot perfectly horizontally to the floor, across the accelerating lab. (View this from a nonaccelerating frame outside the lab.) Relative to the height of the laser, where will the laser beam hit the far wall? What does this say about the effect of a gravitational field on light? Does the fact that light has no mass make any difference to the argument?

12\. 

As a person approaches the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole, outside observers see all the processes of that person (their clocks, their heart rate, etc.) slowing down, and coming to a halt as they reach the Schwarzschild radius. (The person falling into the black hole sees their own processes unaffected.) But the speed of light is the same everywhere for all observers. What does this say about space as you approach the black hole?

Comet P/1999 R1 has a perihelion of 0.0570 AU and aphelion of 4.99 AU. Using the results of the previous problem, find its speed at aphelion. (_Hint:_ The expression is for the perihelion. Use symmetry to rewrite the expression for aphelion.)

### Challenge Problems

[81][51]. 

A tunnel is dug through the center of a perfectly spherical and airless planet of radius _R_. Using the expression for _g_ derived in [Gravitation Near Earth’s Surface][52] for a uniform density, show that a particle of mass _m_ dropped in the tunnel will execute simple harmonic motion. Deduce the period of oscillation of _m_ and show that it has the same period as an orbit at the surface.

82\. 

Following the technique used in [Gravitation Near Earth’s Surface][52], find the value of _g_ as a function of the radius _r_ from the center of a spherical shell planet of constant density ρ with inner and outer radii Rin and Rout . Find _g_ for both Rin<r<Rout and for r<Rin. Assuming the inside of the shell is kept airless, describe travel inside the spherical shell planet.

[83][53]. 

Show that the areal velocity for a circular orbit of radius _r_ about a mass _M_ is ΔAΔt=12√GMr. Does your expression give the correct value for Earth’s areal velocity about the Sun?

84\. 

Show that the period of orbit for two masses, m1 and m2, in circular orbits of radii r1 and r2, respectively, about their common center-of-mass, is given by T=2π√r3G(m1+m2)wherer=r1+r2. (_Hint:_ The masses orbit at radii r1 and r2, respectively where r=r1+r2. Use the expression for the center-of-mass to relate the two radii and note that the two masses must have equal but opposite momenta. Start with the relationship of the period to the circumference and speed of orbit for one of the masses. Use the result of the previous problem using momenta in the expressions for the kinetic energy.)

[85][54]. 

Show that for small changes in height _h_, such that h<<RE, [Equation 13.4][55] reduces to the expression ΔU=mgh.

86\. 

Using [Figure 13.9][56], carefully sketch a free body diagram for the case of a simple pendulum hanging at latitude lambda, labeling all forces acting on the point mass, _m_. Set up the equations of motion for equilibrium, setting one coordinate in the direction of the centripetal acceleration (toward _P_ in the diagram), the other perpendicular to that. Show that the deflection angle ε, defined as the angle between the pendulum string and the radial direction toward the center of Earth, is given by the expression below. What is the deflection angle at latitude 45 degrees? Assume that Earth is a perfect sphere. tan(λ+ε)=g(g−ω2RE)tanλ, where ω is the angular velocity of Earth.

[87][57]. 

(a) Show that tidal force on a small object of mass _m_, defined as the _difference_ in the gravitational force that would be exerted on _m_ at a distance at the near and the far side of the object, due to the gravitation at a distance _R_ from _M_, is given by Ftidal=2GMmR3Δr where Δr is the distance between the near and far side and Δr<<R. (b) Assume you are falling feet first into the black hole at the center of our galaxy. It has mass of 4 million solar masses. What would be the difference between the force at your head and your feet at the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon)? Assume your feet and head each have mass 5.0 kg and are 2.0 m apart. Would you survive passing through the event horizon?

88\. 

Find the Hohmann transfer velocities, ΔvEllipseEarth and ΔvEllipseMars, needed for a trip to Mars. Use [Equation 13.7][58] to find the circular orbital velocities for Earth and Mars. Using [Equation 13.4][55] and the total energy of the ellipse (with semi-major axis _a_), given by E=−GmMs2a, find the velocities at Earth (perihelion) and at Mars (aphelion) required to be on the transfer ellipse. The difference, Δv, at each point is the velocity boost or transfer velocity needed.

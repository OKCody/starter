### Learning Objectives

  - Describe vectors in two and three dimensions in terms of their components, using unit vectors along the axes.
  - Distinguish between the vector components of a vector and the scalar components of a vector.

Vectors are usually described in terms of their components in a **coordinate system**. Even in everyday life we naturally invoke the concept of orthogonal projections in a rectangular coordinate system. For example, if you ask someone for directions to a particular location, you will more likely be told to go 40 km east and 30 km north than 50 km in the direction 37° north of east.

In a rectangular (Cartesian) _xy_-coordinate system in a plane, a point in a plane is described by a pair of coordinates (_x_, _y_). In a similar fashion, a vector →A in a plane is described by a pair of its _vector_ coordinates. The _x_-coordinate of vector →A is called its _x_-component and the _y_-coordinate of vector →A is called its _y_-component. The vector _x_-component is a vector denoted by →Ax. The vector _y_-component is a vector denoted by →Ay. In the Cartesian system, the _x_ and _y_ **vector components** of a vector are the orthogonal projections of this vector onto the _x_\- and _y_-axes, respectively. In this way, following the parallelogram rule for vector addition, each vector on a Cartesian plane can be expressed as the vector sum of its vector components:

→A=→Ax+→Ay.(2.10) 

As illustrated in Figure 2.16, vector →A is the diagonal of the rectangle where the _x_-component →Ax is the side parallel to the _x_-axis and the _y_-component →Ay is the side parallel to the _y_-axis. Vector component →Ax is orthogonal to vector component →Ay.

![Vector A is shown in the x y coordinate system and extends from point b at A’s tail to point e and its head. Vector A points up and to the right. Unit vectors I hat and j hat are small vectors pointing in the x and y directions, respectively, and are at right angles to each other. The x component of vector A is a vector pointing horizontally from the point b to a point directly below point e at the tip of vector A. On the x axis, we see that the vector A sub x extends from x sub b to x sub e and is equal to magnitude A sub x times I hat. The magnitude A sub x equals x sub e minus x sub b. The y component of vector A is a vector pointing vertically from point b to a point directly to the left of point e at the tip of vector A. On the y axis, we see that the vector A sub y extends from y sub b to y sub e and is equal to magnitude A sub y times j hat. The magnitude A sub y equals y sub e minus y sub b.][1] Figure 2.16 Vector →A in a plane in the Cartesian coordinate system is the vector sum of its vector _x_\- and _y_-components. The _x_-vector component →Ax is the orthogonal projection of vector →A onto the _x_-axis. The _y_-vector component →Ay is the orthogonal projection of vector →A onto the _y_-axis. The numbers Ax and Ay that multiply the unit vectors are the scalar components of the vector. 

It is customary to denote the positive direction on the _x_-axis by the unit vector ˆi and the positive direction on the _y_-axis by the unit vector ˆj. **Unit vectors of the axes**, ˆi and ˆj, define two orthogonal directions in the plane. As shown in Figure 2.16, the _x_\- and _y_\- components of a vector can now be written in terms of the unit vectors of the axes:

{→Ax=Axˆi→Ay=Ayˆj.(2.11) 

The vectors →Ax and →Ay defined by Equation 2.11 are the _vector components_ of vector →A. The numbers Ax and Ay that define the vector components in Equation 2.11 are the **scalar component****s** of vector →A. Combining Equation 2.10 with Equation 2.11, we obtain **the component form of a vector**:

→A=Axˆi+Ayˆj.(2.12) 

If we know the coordinates b(xb,yb) of the origin point of a vector (where _b_ stands for “beginning”) and the coordinates e(xe,ye) of the end point of a vector (where _e_ stands for “end”), we can obtain the scalar components of a vector simply by subtracting the origin point coordinates from the end point coordinates:

{Ax=xe−xbAy=ye−yb.(2.13) 

### Example 2.3 

Displacement of a Mouse Pointer A mouse pointer on the display monitor of a computer at its initial position is at point (6.0 cm, 1.6 cm) with respect to the lower left-side corner. If you move the pointer to an icon located at point (2.0 cm, 4.5 cm), what is the displacement vector of the pointer?

Strategy The origin of the _xy_-coordinate system is the lower left-side corner of the computer monitor. Therefore, the unit vector ˆi on the _x_-axis points horizontally to the right and the unit vector ˆj on the _y_-axis points vertically upward. The origin of the displacement vector is located at point _b_(6.0, 1.6) and the end of the displacement vector is located at point _e_(2.0, 4.5). Substitute the coordinates of these points into Equation 2.13 to find the scalar components Dx and Dy of the displacement vector →D. Finally, substitute the coordinates into Equation 2.12 to write the displacement vector in the vector component form.

Solution We identify xb=6.0, xe=2.0, yb=1.6, and ye=4.5, where the physical unit is 1 cm. The scalar _x_\- and _y_-components of the displacement vector are

Dx=xe−xb=(2.0−6.0)cm=−4.0cm,Dy=ye−yb=(4.5−1.6)cm=+2.9cm.

The vector component form of the displacement vector is

→D=Dxˆi+Dyˆj=(−4.0cm)ˆi+(2.9cm)ˆj=(−4.0ˆi+2.9ˆj)cm.(2.14) 

This solution is shown in Figure 2.17.

![Vector D extends from coordinates 6.0, 1.6 to coordinates 2.0, 4.5. Vector D equals vector D sub x plus vector D sub y. D sub x equals minus 4.0 I hat, and extends from x=6.0 to x =2.0. The magnitude D sub x equals 2.0-6.0 = -4.0. D sub y equals plus 2.9 j hat, and extends from y=1.6 to y=4.5. The magnitude D sub y equals 4.5 − 1.6.][2] Figure 2.17 The graph of the displacement vector. The vector points from the origin point at _b_ to the end point at _e_. 

Significance Notice that the physical unit—here, 1 cm—can be placed either with each component immediately before the unit vector or globally for both components, as in Equation 2.14. Often, the latter way is more convenient because it is simpler.

The vector _x_-component →Dx=−4.0ˆi=4.0(−ˆi) of the displacement vector has the magnitude |→Dx|=|−4.0||ˆi|=4.0 because the magnitude of the unit vector is |ˆi|=1. Notice, too, that the direction of the _x_-component is −ˆi, which is antiparallel to the direction of the +_x_-axis; hence, the _x_-component vector →Dx points to the left, as shown in Figure 2.17. The scalar _x_-component of vector →D is Dx=−4.0.

Similarly, the vector _y_-component →Dy=+2.9ˆj of the displacement vector has magnitude |→Dy|=|2.9||ˆj|=2.9 because the magnitude of the unit vector is |ˆj|=1. The direction of the _y_-component is +ˆj, which is parallel to the direction of the +_y_-axis. Therefore, the _y_-component vector →Dy points up, as seen in Figure 2.17. The scalar _y_-component of vector →D is Dy=+2.9. The displacement vector →D is the resultant of its two _vector_ components.

The vector component form of the displacement vector Equation 2.14 tells us that the mouse pointer has been moved on the monitor 4.0 cm to the left and 2.9 cm upward from its initial position.

A blue fly lands on a sheet of graph paper at a point located 10.0 cm to the right of its left edge and 8.0 cm above its bottom edge and walks slowly to a point located 5.0 cm from the left edge and 5.0 cm from the bottom edge. Choose the rectangular coordinate system with the origin at the lower left-side corner of the paper and find the displacement vector of the fly. Illustrate your solution by graphing.

When we know the scalar components Ax and Ay of a vector →A, we can find its magnitude _A_ and its direction angle θA. The **direction angle**—or direction, for short—is the angle the vector forms with the positive direction on the _x_-axis. The angle θA is measured in the _counterclockwise direction_ from the +_x_-axis to the vector (Figure 2.18). Because the lengths _A_, Ax, and Ay form a right triangle, they are related by the Pythagorean theorem:

A2=A2x+A2y⇔A=√A2x+A2y.(2.15) 

This equation works even if the scalar components of a vector are negative. The direction angle θA of a vector is defined via the tangent function of angle θA in the triangle shown in Figure 2.18:

tanθ=AyAx(2.16) ![Vector A has horizontal x component A sub x equal to magnitude A sub x I hat and vertical y component A sub y equal to magnitude A sub y j hat. Vector A and the components form a right triangle with sides length magnitude A sub x and magnitude A sub y and hypotenuse magnitude A equal to the square root of A sub x squared plus A sub y squared. The angle between the horizontal side A sub x and the hypotenuse A is theta sub A.][3] Figure 2.18 When the vector lies either in the first quadrant or in the fourth quadrant, where component Axis positive (Figure 2.19), the direction angle θA in Equation 2.16) is identical to the angle θ.

When the vector lies either in the first quadrant or in the fourth quadrant, where component AxAx is positive (Figure 2.19), the angle θθ in Equation 2.16 is identical to the direction angle θAθA. For vectors in the fourth quadrant, angle θθ is negative, which means that for these vectors, direction angle θAθA is measured _clockwise_ from the positive _x_-axis. Similarly, for vectors in the second quadrant, angle θθ is negative. When the vector lies in either the second or third quadrant, where component AxAx is negative, the direction angle is θA=θ+180°θA=θ+180° (Figure 2.19).

![Figure I shows vector A in the first quadrant \(pointing up and right.\) It has positive x and y components A sub x and A sub y, and the angle theta sub A measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis is smaller than 90 degrees. Figure II shows vector A in the first second \(pointing up and left.\) It has negative x and positive y components A sub x and A sub y. The angle theta sub A measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis is larger than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees. The angle theta, measured clockwise from the negative x axis, is smaller than 90 degrees. Figure III shows vector A in the third quadrant \(pointing down and left.\) It has negative x and y components A sub x and A sub y, and the angle theta sub A measured counterclockwise from the positive x axis is larger than 180 degrees and smaller than 270 degrees. The angle theta, measured counterclockwise from the negative x axis, is smaller than 90 degrees. Figure IV shows vector A in the fourth quadrant \(pointing down and right.\) It has positive x and negative y components A sub x and A sub y, and the angle theta sub A measured clockwise from the positive x axis is smaller than 90 degrees.][4] Figure 2.19 Scalar components of a vector may be positive or negative. Vectors in the first quadrant (I) have both scalar components positive and vectors in the third quadrant have both scalar components negative. For vectors in quadrants II and III, the direction angle of a vector is θA=θ+180°θA=θ+180°.

### Example 2.4 

Magnitude and Direction of the Displacement VectorYou move a mouse pointer on the display monitor from its initial position at point (6.0 cm, 1.6 cm) to an icon located at point (2.0 cm, 4.5 cm). What are the magnitude and direction of the displacement vector of the pointer?

Strategy In Example 2.3, we found the displacement vector D→D→ of the mouse pointer (see Equation 2.14). We identify its scalar components Dx=−4.0cmDx=−4.0cm and Dy=+2.9cmDy=+2.9cm and substitute into Equation 2.15 and Equation 2.16 to find the magnitude _D_ and direction θDθD, respectively.

Solution The magnitude of vector D→D→ is

D=Dx2+Dy2=(−4.0cm)2+(2.9cm)2=(4.0)2+(2.9)2cm=4.9cm.D=Dx2+Dy2=(−4.0cm)2+(2.9cm)2=(4.0)2+(2.9)2cm=4.9cm.

The direction angle is

tanθ=DyDx=+2.9cm−4.0cm=−0.725⇒θ=tan−1(−0.725)=−35.9°.tanθ=DyDx=+2.9cm−4.0cm=−0.725⇒θ=tan−1(−0.725)=−35.9°.

Vector D→D→ lies in the second quadrant, so its direction angle is

θD=θ+180°=−35.9°+180°=144.1°.θD=θ+180°=−35.9°+180°=144.1°. Check Your Understanding 2.5 

If the displacement vector of a blue fly walking on a sheet of graph paper is D→=(−5.00i^−3.00j^)cmD→=(−5.00i^−3.00j^)cm, find its magnitude and direction.

In many applications, the magnitudes and directions of vector quantities are known and we need to find the resultant of many vectors. For example, imagine 400 cars moving on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco in a strong wind. Each car gives the bridge a different push in various directions and we would like to know how big the resultant push can possibly be. We have already gained some experience with the geometric construction of vector sums, so we know the task of finding the resultant by drawing the vectors and measuring their lengths and angles may become intractable pretty quickly, leading to huge errors. Worries like this do not appear when we use analytical methods. The very first step in an analytical approach is to find vector components when the direction and magnitude of a vector are known.

Let us return to the right triangle in Figure 2.18. The quotient of the adjacent side AxAx to the hypotenuse _A_ is the cosine function of direction angle θAθA, Ax/A=cosθAAx/A=cosθA, and the quotient of the opposite side AyAy to the hypotenuse _A_ is the sine function of θAθA, Ay/A=sinθAAy/A=sinθA. When magnitude _A_ and direction θAθA are known, we can solve these relations for the scalar components:

{Ax=AcosθAAy=AsinθA.{Ax=AcosθAAy=AsinθA.(2.17) 

When calculating vector components with Equation 2.17, care must be taken with the angle. The direction angle θAθA of a vector is the angle measured _counterclockwise_ from the positive direction on the _x_-axis to the vector. The clockwise measurement gives a negative angle.

### Example 2.5 

Components of Displacement Vectors A rescue party for a missing child follows a search dog named Trooper. Trooper wanders a lot and makes many trial sniffs along many different paths. Trooper eventually finds the child and the story has a happy ending, but his displacements on various legs seem to be truly convoluted. On one of the legs he walks 200.0 m southeast, then he runs north some 300.0 m. On the third leg, he examines the scents carefully for 50.0 m in the direction 30°30° west of north. On the fourth leg, Trooper goes directly south for 80.0 m, picks up a fresh scent and turns 23°23° west of south for 150.0 m. Find the scalar components of Trooper’s displacement vectors and his displacement vectors in vector component form for each leg.

Strategy Let’s adopt a rectangular coordinate system with the positive _x_-axis in the direction of geographic east, with the positive _y_-direction pointed to geographic north. Explicitly, the unit vector i^i^ of the _x_-axis points east and the unit vector j^j^ of the _y_-axis points north. Trooper makes five legs, so there are five displacement vectors. We start by identifying their magnitudes and direction angles, then we use Equation 2.17 to find the scalar components of the displacements and Equation 2.12 for the displacement vectors.

Solution On the first leg, the displacement magnitude is L1=200.0mL1=200.0m and the direction is southeast. For direction angle θ1θ1 we can take either 45°45° measured clockwise from the east direction or 45°+270°45°+270° measured counterclockwise from the east direction. With the first choice, θ1=−45°θ1=−45°. With the second choice, θ1=+315°θ1=+315°. We can use either one of these two angles. The components are

L1x=L1cosθ1=(200.0m)cos315°=141.4m,L1y=L1sinθ1=(200.0m)sin315°=−141.4m.L1x=L1cosθ1=(200.0m)cos315°=141.4m,L1y=L1sinθ1=(200.0m)sin315°=−141.4m.

The displacement vector of the first leg is

L→1=L1xi^+L1yj^=(141.4i^−141.4j^)m.L→1=L1xi^+L1yj^=(141.4i^−141.4j^)m.

On the second leg of Trooper’s wanderings, the magnitude of the displacement is L2=300.0mL2=300.0m and the direction is north. The direction angle is θ2=+90°θ2=+90°. We obtain the following results:

L2x=L2cosθ2=(300.0m)cos90°=0.0,L2y=L2sinθ2=(300.0m)sin90°=300.0m,L→2=L2xi^+L2yj^=(300.0m)j^.L2x=L2cosθ2=(300.0m)cos90°=0.0,L2y=L2sinθ2=(300.0m)sin90°=300.0m,L→2=L2xi^+L2yj^=(300.0m)j^.

On the third leg, the displacement magnitude is L3=50.0mL3=50.0m and the direction is 30°30° west of north. The direction angle measured counterclockwise from the eastern direction is θ3=30°+90°=+120°θ3=30°+90°=+120°. This gives the following answers:

L3x=L3cosθ3=(50.0m)cos120°=−25.0m,L3y=L3sinθ3=(50.0m)sin120°=+43.3m,L→3=L3xi^+L3yj^=(−25.0i^+43.3j^)m.L3x=L3cosθ3=(50.0m)cos120°=−25.0m,L3y=L3sinθ3=(50.0m)sin120°=+43.3m,L→3=L3xi^+L3yj^=(−25.0i^+43.3j^)m.

On the fourth leg of the excursion, the displacement magnitude is L4=80.0mL4=80.0m and the direction is south. The direction angle can be taken as either θ4=−90°θ4=−90° or θ4=+270°θ4=+270°. We obtain

L4x=L4cosθ4=(80.0m)cos(−90°)=0,L4y=L4sinθ4=(80.0m)sin(−90°)=−80.0m,L→4=L4xi^+L4yj^=(−80.0m)j^.L4x=L4cosθ4=(80.0m)cos(−90°)=0,L4y=L4sinθ4=(80.0m)sin(−90°)=−80.0m,L→4=L4xi^+L4yj^=(−80.0m)j^.

On the last leg, the magnitude is L5=150.0mL5=150.0m and the angle is θ5=−23°+270°=+247°θ5=−23°+270°=+247° (23°(23° west of south), which gives

L5x=L5cosθ5=(150.0m)cos247°=−58.6m,L5y=L5sinθ5=(150.0m)sin247°=−138.1m,L→5=L5xi^+L5yj^=(−58.6i^−138.1j^)m.L5x=L5cosθ5=(150.0m)cos247°=−58.6m,L5y=L5sinθ5=(150.0m)sin247°=−138.1m,L→5=L5xi^+L5yj^=(−58.6i^−138.1j^)m. Check Your Understanding 2.6 

If Trooper runs 20 m west before taking a rest, what is his displacement vector?

### Polar Coordinates

To describe locations of points or vectors in a plane, we need two orthogonal directions. In the Cartesian coordinate system these directions are given by unit vectors i^i^ and j^j^ along the _x_-axis and the _y_-axis, respectively. The Cartesian coordinate system is very convenient to use in describing displacements and velocities of objects and the forces acting on them. However, it becomes cumbersome when we need to describe the rotation of objects. When describing rotation, we usually work in the **polar coordinate system**.

In the polar coordinate system, the location of point _P_ in a plane is given by two **polar coordinates** (Figure 2.20). The first polar coordinate is the **radial coordinate** _r_, which is the distance of point _P_ from the origin. The second polar coordinate is an angle φφ that the radial vector makes with some chosen direction, usually the positive _x_-direction. In polar coordinates, angles are measured in radians, or rads. The radial vector is attached at the origin and points away from the origin to point _P._ This radial direction is described by a unit radial vector r^r^. The second unit vector t^t^ is a vector orthogonal to the radial direction r^r^. The positive +t^+t^ direction indicates how the angle φφ changes in the counterclockwise direction. In this way, a point _P_ that has coordinates (_x_, _y_) in the rectangular system can be described equivalently in the polar coordinate system by the two polar coordinates (r,φ)(r,φ). Equation 2.17 is valid for any vector, so we can use it to express the _x_\- and _y_-coordinates of vector r→r→. In this way, we obtain the connection between the polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates of point _P_:

{x=rcosφy=rsinφ.{x=rcosφy=rsinφ.(2.18) ![Vector r points from the origin of the x y coordinate system to point P. The angle between the vector r and the positive x direction is phi. X equals r cosine phi and y equals r sine phi. Extending a line in the direction of r vector past point P, a unit vector r hat is drawn in the same direction as r. A unit vector t hat is perpendicular to r hat, pointing 90 degrees counterclockwise to r hat.][5] Figure 2.20 Using polar coordinates, the unit vector r^r^ defines the positive direction along the radius _r_ (radial direction) and, orthogonal to it, the unit vector t^t^ defines the positive direction of rotation by the angle φφ. 

### Example 2.6 

Polar Coordinates A treasure hunter finds one silver coin at a location 20.0 m away from a dry well in the direction 20°20° north of east and finds one gold coin at a location 10.0 m away from the well in the direction 20°20° north of west. What are the polar and rectangular coordinates of these findings with respect to the well?

Strategy The well marks the origin of the coordinate system and east is the +_x_-direction. We identify radial distances from the locations to the origin, which are rS=20.0mrS=20.0m (for the silver coin) and rG=10.0mrG=10.0m (for the gold coin). To find the angular coordinates, we convert 20°20° to radians: 20°=π20/180=π/920°=π20/180=π/9. We use Equation 2.18 to find the _x_\- and _y_-coordinates of the coins.

Solution The angular coordinate of the silver coin is φS=π/9φS=π/9, whereas the angular coordinate of the gold coin is φG=π−π/9=8π/9φG=π−π/9=8π/9. Hence, the polar coordinates of the silver coin are (rS,φS)=(20.0m,π/9)(rS,φS)=(20.0m,π/9) and those of the gold coin are (rG,φG)=(10.0m,8π/9)(rG,φG)=(10.0m,8π/9). We substitute these coordinates into Equation 2.18 to obtain rectangular coordinates. For the gold coin, the coordinates are

{xG=rGcosφG=(10.0m)cos8π/9=−9.4myG=rGsinφG=(10.0m)sin8π/9=3.4m⇒(xG,yG)=(−9.4m,3.4m).{xG=rGcosφG=(10.0m)cos8π/9=−9.4myG=rGsinφG=(10.0m)sin8π/9=3.4m⇒(xG,yG)=(−9.4m,3.4m).

For the silver coin, the coordinates are

{xS=rScosφS=(20.0m)cosπ/9=18.9myS=rSsinφS=(20.0m)sinπ/9=6.8m⇒(xS,yS)=(18.9m,6.8m).{xS=rScosφS=(20.0m)cosπ/9=18.9myS=rSsinφS=(20.0m)sinπ/9=6.8m⇒(xS,yS)=(18.9m,6.8m).

### Vectors in Three Dimensions

To specify the location of a point in space, we need three coordinates (_x_, _y_, _z_), where coordinates _x_ and _y_ specify locations in a plane, and coordinate _z_ gives a vertical position above or below the plane. Three-dimensional space has three orthogonal directions, so we need not two but _three_ unit vectors to define a three-dimensional coordinate system. In the Cartesian coordinate system, the first two unit vectors are the unit vector of the _x_-axis i^i^ and the unit vector of the _y_-axis j^j^. The third unit vector k^k^ is the direction of the _z_-axis (Figure 2.21). The order in which the axes are labeled, which is the order in which the three unit vectors appear, is important because it defines the orientation of the coordinate system. The order _x_-_y_-_z_, which is equivalent to the order i^i^ \- j^j^ \- k^k^, defines the standard right-handed coordinate system (positive orientation).

![The x y z coordinate system, with unit vectors I hat, j hat and k hat respectively. I hat points out at us, j hat points to the right, and k hat points up the page. The unit vectors form the sides of a cube.][6] Figure 2.21 Three unit vectors define a Cartesian system in three-dimensional space. The order in which these unit vectors appear defines the orientation of the coordinate system. The order shown here defines the right-handed orientation. 

In three-dimensional space, vector A→A→ has three vector components: the _x_-component A→x=Axi^A→x=Axi^, which is the part of vector A→A→ along the _x_-axis; the _y_-component A→y=Ayj^A→y=Ayj^, which is the part of A→A→ along the _y_-axis; and the _z_-component A→z=Azk^A→z=Azk^, which is the part of the vector along the _z_-axis. A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components (Figure 2.22):

A→=Axi^+Ayj^+Azk^.A→=Axi^+Ayj^+Azk^.(2.19) 

If we know the coordinates of its origin b(xb,yb,zb)b(xb,yb,zb) and of its end e(xe,ye,ze)e(xe,ye,ze), its scalar components are obtained by taking their differences: AxAx and AyAy are given by Equation 2.13 and the _z_-component is given by

Az=ze−zb.Az=ze−zb.(2.20) 

Magnitude _A_ is obtained by generalizing Equation 2.15 to three dimensions:

A=Ax2+Ay2+Az2.A=Ax2+Ay2+Az2.(2.21) 

This expression for the vector magnitude comes from applying the Pythagorean theorem twice. As seen in Figure 2.22, the diagonal in the _xy_-plane has length Ax2+Ay2Ax2+Ay2 and its square adds to the square Az2Az2 to give A2A2. Note that when the _z_-component is zero, the vector lies entirely in the _xy_-plane and its description is reduced to two dimensions.

![Vector A in the x y z coordinate system extends from the origin. Vector A equals the sum of vectors A sub x, A sub y and A sub z. Vector A sub x is the x component along the x axis and has length A sub x I hat. Vector A sub y is the y component along the y axis and has length A sub y j hat. Vector A sub z is the z component along the z axis and has length A sub x k hat. The components form the sides of a rectangular box with sides length A sub x, A sub y, and A sub z.][7] Figure 2.22 A vector in three-dimensional space is the vector sum of its three vector components. 

### Example 2.7 

Takeoff of a Drone During a takeoff of IAI Heron (Figure 2.23), its position with respect to a control tower is 100 m above the ground, 300 m to the east, and 200 m to the north. One minute later, its position is 250 m above the ground, 1200 m to the east, and 2100 m to the north. What is the drone’s displacement vector with respect to the control tower? What is the magnitude of its displacement vector?

Strategy We take the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system as the control tower. The direction of the +_x_-axis is given by unit vector i^i^ to the east, the direction of the +_y_-axis is given by unit vector j^j^ to the north, and the direction of the +_z_-axis is given by unit vector k^k^, which points up from the ground. The drone’s first position is the origin (or, equivalently, the beginning) of the displacement vector and its second position is the end of the displacement vector.

SolutionWe identify _b_(300.0 m, 200.0 m, 100.0 m) and _e_(1200 m, 2100 m, 250 m), and use Equation 2.13 and Equation 2.20 to find the scalar components of the drone’s displacement vector:

{Dx=xe−xb=1200.0m−300.0m=900.0m,Dy=ye−yb=2100.0m−200.0m=1900.0m,Dz=ze−zb=250.0m−100.0m=150.0m.{Dx=xe−xb=1200.0m−300.0m=900.0m,Dy=ye−yb=2100.0m−200.0m=1900.0m,Dz=ze−zb=250.0m−100.0m=150.0m.

We substitute these components into Equation 2.19 to find the displacement vector:

D→=Dxi^+Dyj^+Dzk^=900.0mi^+1900.0mj^+150.0mk^=(0.90i^+1.90j^+0.15k^)km.D→=Dxi^+Dyj^+Dzk^=900.0mi^+1900.0mj^+150.0mk^=(0.90i^+1.90j^+0.15k^)km.

We substitute into Equation 2.21 to find the magnitude of the displacement:

D=Dx2+Dy2+Dz2=(0.90km)2+(1.90km)2+(0.15km)2=2.11km.D=Dx2+Dy2+Dz2=(0.90km)2+(1.90km)2+(0.15km)2=2.11km. Check Your Understanding 2.7 

If the average velocity vector of the drone in the displacement in Example 2.7 is u→=(15.0i^+31.7j^+2.5k^)m/su→=(15.0i^+31.7j^+2.5k^)m/s, what is the magnitude of the drone’s velocity vector?

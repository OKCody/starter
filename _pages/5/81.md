Why does Earth keep on spinning? What started it spinning to begin with? Why doesn’t Earth’s gravitational attraction not bring the Moon crashing in toward Earth? And how does an ice skater manage to spin faster and faster simply by pulling her arms in? Why does she not have to exert a torque to spin faster?

Questions like these have answers based in angular momentum, the rotational analog to linear momentum. In this chapter, we first define and then explore angular momentum from a variety of viewpoints. First, however, we investigate the angular momentum of a single particle. This allows us to develop angular momentum for a system of particles and for a rigid body that is cylindrically symmetric.

### Angular Momentum of a Single Particle

Figure 11.9 shows a particle at a position →r with linear momentum →p=m→v with respect to the origin. Even if the particle is not rotating about the origin, we can still define an angular momentum in terms of the position vector and the linear momentum.

### Angular Momentum of a Particle

The **angular momentum** →l of a particle is defined as the cross-product of →r and →p, and is perpendicular to the plane containing →r and →p:

→l=→r×→p.(11.5) ![An x y z coordinate system is shown in which x points out of the page, y points to the right and z points up. The vector r points from the origin to a point in the x y plane, in the first quadrant. The vector points from the tip of the r vector, at an angle of theta counterclockwise from the r vector direction, as viewed from above. Both r and p vectors are in the x y plane. The vector l points up, and is perpendicular to the x y plane, consistent with the right hand rule. When the right hand has its fingers curling counterclockwise as viewed from above, the thumb points up, in the direction of l. We are also shown the components of the vector r parallel and perpendicular to the p vector. The vector r sub perpendicular is the projection of the r vector perpendicular to the p vector direction.][1] Figure 11.9 In three-dimensional space, the position vector →r locates a particle in the _xy_-plane with linear momentum →p. The angular momentum with respect to the origin is →l=→r×→p, which is in the _z_-direction. The direction of →l is given by the right-hand rule, as shown. 

The intent of choosing the direction of the angular momentum to be perpendicular to the plane containing →r and →p is similar to choosing the direction of torque to be perpendicular to the plane of →rand→F, as discussed in [Fixed-Axis Rotation][2]. The magnitude of the angular momentum is found from the definition of the cross-product,

l=rpsinθ,

where θ is the angle between →r and →p. The units of angular momentum are kg·m2/s.

As with the definition of torque, we can define a lever arm r⊥ that is the perpendicular distance from the momentum vector →p to the origin, r⊥=rsinθ. With this definition, the magnitude of the angular momentum becomes

l=r⊥p=r⊥mv.

We see that if the direction of →p is such that it passes through the origin, then θ=0, and the angular momentum is zero because the lever arm is zero. In this respect, the magnitude of the angular momentum depends on the choice of origin.

If we take the time derivative of the angular momentum, we arrive at an expression for the torque on the particle:

d→ldt=d→rdt×→p+→r×d→pdt=→v×m→v+→r×d→pdt=→r×d→pdt.

Here we have used the definition of →p and the fact that a vector crossed into itself is zero. From Newton’s second law, d→pdt=∑→F, the net force acting on the particle, and the definition of the net torque, we can write

d→ldt=∑→τ.(11.6) 

Note the similarity with the linear result of Newton’s second law, d→pdt=∑→F. The following problem-solving strategy can serve as a guideline for calculating the angular momentum of a particle.

### 

#### Problem-Solving Strategy: Angular Momentum of a Particle

  1. Choose a coordinate system about which the angular momentum is to be calculated.
  2. Write down the radius vector to the point particle in unit vector notation.
  3. Write the linear momentum vector of the particle in unit vector notation.
  4. Take the cross product →l=→r×→p and use the right-hand rule to establish the direction of the angular momentum vector.
  5. See if there is a time dependence in the expression of the angular momentum vector. If there is, then a torque exists about the origin, and use d→ldt=∑→τ to calculate the torque. If there is no time dependence in the expression for the angular momentum, then the net torque is zero.

### Example 11.4 

Angular Momentum and Torque on a Meteor A meteor enters Earth’s atmosphere (Figure 11.10) and is observed by someone on the ground before it burns up in the atmosphere. The vector →r=25kmˆi+25kmˆj gives the position of the meteor with respect to the observer. At the instant the observer sees the meteor, it has linear momentum →p=15.0kg(−2.0km/sˆj), and it is accelerating at a constant 2.0m/s2(−ˆj) along its path, which for our purposes can be taken as a straight line. (a) What is the angular momentum of the meteor about the origin, which is at the location of the observer? (b) What is the torque on the meteor about the origin?

![An x y coordinate system is shown, with positive x to the right, along the ground, and positive y vertically upward. An observer is shown near the origin. A vector r is shown from the origin to a meteor at some large positive x and positive y coordinates. The vector p at the location of the meteor points down.][3] Figure 11.10 An observer on the ground sees a meteor at position →r with linear momentum →p. 

Strategy We resolve the acceleration into _x_\- and _y_-components and use the kinematic equations to express the velocity as a function of acceleration and time. We insert these expressions into the linear momentum and then calculate the angular momentum using the cross-product. Since the position and momentum vectors are in the _xy_-plane, we expect the angular momentum vector to be along the _z_-axis. To find the torque, we take the time derivative of the angular momentum.

Solution The meteor is entering Earth’s atmosphere at an angle of 90.0° below the horizontal, so the components of the acceleration in the _x_\- and _y_-directions are

ax=0,ay=−2.0m/s2.

We write the velocities using the kinematic equations.

vx=0,vy=−2.0×103m/s−(2.0m/s2)t.

  1. The angular momentum is  
→l=→r×→p=(25.0kmˆi+25.0kmˆj)×15.0kg(0ˆi+vyˆj)=15.0kg[25.0km(vy)ˆk]=15.0kg[2.50×104m(−2.0×103m/s−(2.0m/s2)t)ˆk].  
At t=0, the angular momentum of the meteor about the origin is  
→l0=15.0kg[2.50×104m(−2.0×103m/s)ˆk]=7.50×108kg·m2/s(−ˆk).  
This is the instant that the observer sees the meteor.
  2. To find the torque, we take the time derivative of the angular momentum. Taking the time derivative of →l as a function of time, which is the second equation immediately above, we have  
d→ldt=−15.0kg(2.50×104m)(2.0m/s2)ˆk.  
Then, since d→ldt=∑→τ, we have  
∑→τ=−7.5×105N·mˆk.  
The units of torque are given as newton-meters, not to be confused with joules. As a check, we note that the lever arm is the _x_-component of the vector →r in Figure 11.10 since it is perpendicular to the force acting on the meteor, which is along its path. By Newton’s second law, this force is  
→F=ma(−ˆj)=15.0kg(2.0m/s2)(−ˆj)=30.0kg·m/s2(−ˆj).  
The lever arm is  
→r⊥=2.5×104mˆi.  
Thus, the torque is  
∑→τ=→r⊥×→F=(2.5×104mˆi)×(−30.0kg·m/s2ˆj),=7.5×105N·m(−ˆk).

Significance Since the meteor is accelerating downward toward Earth, its radius and velocity vector are changing. Therefore, since →l=→r×→p, the angular momentum is changing as a function of time. The torque on the meteor about the origin, however, is constant, because the lever arm →r⊥ and the force on the meteor are constants. This example is important in that it illustrates that the angular momentum depends on the choice of origin about which it is calculated. The methods used in this example are also important in developing angular momentum for a system of particles and for a rigid body.

### Angular Momentum of a System of Particles

The angular momentum of a system of particles is important in many scientific disciplines, one being astronomy. Consider a spiral galaxy, a rotating island of stars like our own Milky Way. The individual stars can be treated as point particles, each of which has its own angular momentum. The vector sum of the individual angular momenta give the total angular momentum of the galaxy. In this section, we develop the tools with which we can calculate the total angular momentum of a system of particles.

In the preceding section, we introduced the angular momentum of a single particle about a designated origin. The expression for this angular momentum is →l=→r×→p, where the vector →r is from the origin to the particle, and →p is the particle’s linear momentum. If we have a system of _N_ particles, each with position vector from the origin given by →ri and each having momentum →pi, then the total angular momentum of the system of particles about the origin is the vector sum of the individual angular momenta about the origin. That is,

→L=→l1+→l2+⋯+→lN.(11.7) 

Similarly, if particle _i_ is subject to a net torque →τi about the origin, then we can find the net torque about the origin due to the system of particles by differentiating Equation 11.7:

d→Ldt=∑id→lidt=∑i→τi.

The sum of the individual torques produces a net external torque on the system, which we designate ∑→τ. Thus,

d→Ldt=∑→τ.(11.8) 

Equation 11.8 states that _the rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system is equal to the net external torque acting on the system when both quantities are measured with respect to a given origin._ Equation 11.8 can be applied to any system that has net angular momentum, including rigid bodies, as discussed in the next section.

### Example 11.5 

Angular Momentum of Three Particles Referring to Figure 11.11(a), determine the total angular momentum due to the three particles about the origin. (b) What is the rate of change of the angular momentum?

![Three particles in the x y plane with different position and momentum vectors are shown. The x and y axes show position in meters and have a range of -4.0 to 4.0 meters. Particle 1 is at x=-2.0 meters and y=1.0 meters, m sub 1 equals 2.0 kilograms, v sub 1 is 4.0 j hat meters per second, upward, and F sub 1 is -6.0 i hat Newtons to the left. Particle 2 is at x=4.0 meters and y=1.0 meters, m sub 2 equals 4.0 kilograms, v sub 2 is 5.0 i hat meters per second, to the right, and F sub 2 is 10.0 j hat Newtons up. Particle 3 is at x=2.0 meters and y=-2.0 meters, m sub 3 equals 1.0 kilograms, v sub 3 is 3.0 i hat meters per second, to the right, and F sub 3 is -8.0 j hat Newtons down.][5] Figure 11.11 Three particles in the _xy-_plane with different position and momentum vectors. 

Strategy Write down the position and momentum vectors for the three particles. Calculate the individual angular momenta and add them as vectors to find the total angular momentum. Then do the same for the torques.

Solution

  1. Particle 1: →r1=−2.0mˆi+1.0mˆj,→p1=2.0kg(4.0m/sˆj)=8.0kg·m/sˆj,  
→l1=→r1×→p1=−16.0kg·m2/sˆk.  
Particle 2: →r2=4.0mˆi+1.0mˆj,→p2=4.0kg(5.0m/sˆi)=20.0kg·m/sˆi,  
→l2=→r2×→p2=−20.0kg·m2/sˆk.  
Particle 3: r→3=2.0mi^−2.0mj^,p→3=1.0kg(3.0m/si^)=3.0kg·m/si^r→3=2.0mi^−2.0mj^,p→3=1.0kg(3.0m/si^)=3.0kg·m/si^,  
l→3=r→3×p→3=6.0kg·m2/sk^.l→3=r→3×p→3=6.0kg·m2/sk^.  
We add the individual angular momenta to find the total about the origin:  
l→T=l→1+l→2+l→3=−30kg·m2/sk^.l→T=l→1+l→2+l→3=−30kg·m2/sk^.
  2. The individual forces and lever arms are  
r→1⊥=1.0mj^,F→1=−6.0Ni^,τ→1=6.0N·mk^ r→2⊥=4.0mi^,F→2=10.0Nj^,τ→2=40.0N·mk^ r→3⊥=2.0mi^,F→3=−8.0Nj^,τ→3=−16.0N·mk^.r→1⊥=1.0mj^,F→1=−6.0Ni^,τ→1=6.0N·mk^ r→2⊥=4.0mi^,F→2=10.0Nj^,τ→2=40.0N·mk^ r→3⊥=2.0mi^,F→3=−8.0Nj^,τ→3=−16.0N·mk^.  
Therefore:  
∑iτ→i=τ→1+τ→2+τ→3=30N·mk^.∑iτ→i=τ→1+τ→2+τ→3=30N·mk^.

Significance This example illustrates the superposition principle for angular momentum and torque of a system of particles. Care must be taken when evaluating the radius vectors r→ir→i of the particles to calculate the angular momenta, and the lever arms, r→i⊥r→i⊥ to calculate the torques, as they are completely different quantities.

### Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body

We have investigated the angular momentum of a single particle, which we generalized to a system of particles. Now we can use the principles discussed in the previous section to develop the concept of the angular momentum of a rigid body. Celestial objects such as planets have angular momentum due to their spin and orbits around stars. In engineering, anything that rotates about an axis carries angular momentum, such as flywheels, propellers, and rotating parts in engines. Knowledge of the angular momenta of these objects is crucial to the design of the system in which they are a part.

To develop the angular momentum of a rigid body, we model a rigid body as being made up of small mass segments, Δmi.Δmi. In Figure 11.12, a rigid body is constrained to rotate about the _z_-axis with angular velocity ωω. All mass segments that make up the rigid body undergo circular motion about the _z_-axis with the same angular velocity. Part (a) of the figure shows mass segment ΔmiΔmi with position vector r→ir→i from the origin and radius RiRi to the _z_-axis. The magnitude of its tangential velocity is vi=Riωvi=Riω. Because the vectors v→iandr→iv→iandr→i are perpendicular to each other, the magnitude of the angular momentum of this mass segment is

li=ri(Δmvi)sin90°.li=ri(Δmvi)sin90°. ![Figure a shows a door-knob shaped object and an x y z coordinate system. The object is arranged vertically and centered on the z axis, with the wide knob at the top. The object is rotating about the z axis, counterclockwise as viewed from above, with angular velocity omega. A small part of the object is highlighted. This mass segment, labeled Delta m sub i, is located at vector r sub i, moves with velocity vector v sub i, and traces a counterclockwise circle of radius R sub i. The vector r sub i extends from the origin to the mass segment and makes an angle of theta sub i with the z axis. The vector v sub i is tangent to the circle traced by the mass segment. Figure b shows the x y coordinate system and the mass segment. Vectors r sub i and v sub i are shown again, as is the angle theta sub i between the vector r sub i and the z axis. The angular momentum vector of the mass segment, vector l sub i, is also shown. The vector l sub i is perpendicular to both r and v, as given by the right hand rule, and has a z component upward, shown on the diagram and labeled l sub i z. The remaining side of the right triangle whose hypotenuse is l sub i and vertical side is l sub i z is shown as a dashed line. The angle adjacent to this side, and opposite the vertical side l sub i z, is theta sub i.][6] Figure 11.12 (a) A rigid body is constrained to rotate around the _z_-axis. The rigid body is symmetrical about the _z_-axis. A mass segment ΔmiΔmi is located at position r→i,r→i, which makes angle θiθi with respect to the _z_-axis. The circular motion of an infinitesimal mass segment is shown. (b) l→il→i is the angular momentum of the mass segment and has a component along the _z_-axis (l→i)z(l→i)z. 

Using the right-hand rule, the angular momentum vector points in the direction shown in part (b). The sum of the angular momenta of all the mass segments contains components both along and perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Every mass segment has a perpendicular component of the angular momentum that will be cancelled by the perpendicular component of an identical mass segment on the opposite side of the rigid body, because it is cylindrically symmetric. Thus, the component along the axis of rotation is the only component that gives a nonzero value when summed over all the mass segments. From part (b), the component of l→il→i along the axis of rotation is

(li)z=lisinθi=(riΔmivi)sinθi,=(risinθi)(Δmivi)=RiΔmivi.(li)z=lisinθi=(riΔmivi)sinθi,=(risinθi)(Δmivi)=RiΔmivi.

The net angular momentum of the rigid body along the axis of rotation is

L=∑i(l→i)z=∑iRiΔmivi=∑iRiΔmi(Riω)=ω∑iΔmi(Ri)2.L=∑i(l→i)z=∑iRiΔmivi=∑iRiΔmi(Riω)=ω∑iΔmi(Ri)2.

The summation ∑iΔmi(Ri)2∑iΔmi(Ri)2 is simply the moment of inertia _I_ of the rigid body about the axis of rotation. For a thin hoop rotating about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the hoop, all of the RiRi’s are equal to _R_ so the summation reduces to R2∑iΔmi=mR2,R2∑iΔmi=mR2, which is the moment of inertia for a thin hoop found in [Figure 10.20][7]. Thus, the magnitude of the angular momentum along the axis of rotation of a rigid body rotating with angular velocity ωω about the axis is

L=Iω.L=Iω.(11.9) 

This equation is analogous to the magnitude of the linear momentum p=mvp=mv. The direction of the angular momentum vector is directed along the axis of rotation given by the right-hand rule.

### Example 11.6 

Angular Momentum of a Robot Arm A robot arm on a Mars rover like _Curiosity_ shown in [Figure 11.8][8] is 1.0 m long and has forceps at the free end to pick up rocks. The mass of the arm is 2.0 kg and the mass of the forceps is 1.0 kg. See Figure 11.13. The robot arm and forceps move from rest to ω=0.1πrad/sω=0.1πrad/s in 0.1 s. It rotates down and picks up a Mars rock that has mass 1.5 kg. The axis of rotation is the point where the robot arm connects to the rover. (a) What is the angular momentum of the robot arm by itself about the axis of rotation after 0.1 s when the arm has stopped accelerating? (b) What is the angular momentum of the robot arm when it has the Mars rock in its forceps and is rotating upwards? (c) When the arm does not have a rock in the forceps, what is the torque about the point where the arm connects to the rover when it is accelerating from rest to its final angular velocity?

![An illustration of the Mars rover. An arm with a claw at the end extends from one end of the rover and can rotate up and down to pick up a rock. The axis of rotation is the point where the robot arm connects to the rover.][9] Figure 11.13 A robot arm on a Mars rover swings down and picks up a Mars rock. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech) 

Strategy We use Equation 11.9 to find angular momentum in the various configurations. When the arm is rotating downward, the right-hand rule gives the angular momentum vector directed out of the page, which we will call the positive _z_-direction. When the arm is rotating upward, the right-hand rule gives the direction of the angular momentum vector into the page or in the negative _z-_direction. The moment of inertia is the sum of the individual moments of inertia. The arm can be approximated with a solid rod, and the forceps and Mars rock can be approximated as point masses located at a distance of 1 m from the origin. For part (c), we use Newton’s second law of motion for rotation to find the torque on the robot arm.

Solution

  1. Writing down the individual moments of inertia, we have  
Robot arm: IR=13mRr2=13(2.00kg)(1.00m)2=23kg·m2.IR=13mRr2=13(2.00kg)(1.00m)2=23kg·m2.  
Forceps: IF=mFr2=(1.0kg)(1.0m)2=1.0kg·m2.IF=mFr2=(1.0kg)(1.0m)2=1.0kg·m2.  
Mars rock: IMR=mMRr2=(1.5kg)(1.0m)2=1.5kg·m2.IMR=mMRr2=(1.5kg)(1.0m)2=1.5kg·m2.  
Therefore, without the Mars rock, the total moment of inertia is  
ITotal=IR+IF=1.67kg·m2ITotal=IR+IF=1.67kg·m2 and the magnitude of the angular momentum is  
L=Iω=1.67kg·m2(0.1πrad/s)=0.17πkg·m2/s.L=Iω=1.67kg·m2(0.1πrad/s)=0.17πkg·m2/s.  
The angular momentum vector is directed out of the page in the k^k^ direction since the robot arm is rotating counterclockwise.
  2. We must include the Mars rock in the calculation of the moment of inertia, so we have  
ITotal=IR+IF+IMR=3.17kg·m2ITotal=IR+IF+IMR=3.17kg·m2  
and  
L=Iω=3.17kg·m2(0.1πrad/s)=0.32πkg·m2/s.L=Iω=3.17kg·m2(0.1πrad/s)=0.32πkg·m2/s.  
Now the angular momentum vector is directed into the page in the −k^−k^ direction, by the right-hand rule, since the robot arm is now rotating clockwise.
  3. We find the torque when the arm does not have the rock by taking the derivative of the angular momentum using Equation 11.8 dL→dt=∑τ→.dL→dt=∑τ→. But since L=IωL=Iω, and understanding that the direction of the angular momentum and torque vectors are along the axis of rotation, we can suppress the vector notation and find  
dLdt=d(Iω)dt=Idωdt=Iα=∑ τ,dLdt=d(Iω)dt=Idωdt=Iα=∑ τ,  
which is Newton’s second law for rotation. Since α=0.1πrad/s0.1s=πrad/s2α=0.1πrad/s0.1s=πrad/s2, we can calculate the net torque:  
∑ τ=Iα=1.67kg·m2(πrad/s2)=1.67πN·m.∑ τ=Iα=1.67kg·m2(πrad/s2)=1.67πN·m.

Significance The angular momentum in (a) is less than that of (b) due to the fact that the moment of inertia in (b) is greater than (a), while the angular velocity is the same.

### Summary

#### 7.1 Work

  - The infinitesimal increment of work done by a force, acting over an infinitesimal displacement, is the dot product of the force and the displacement.
  - The work done by a force, acting over a finite path, is the integral of the infinitesimal increments of work done along the path.
  - The work done _against_ a force is the negative of the work done _by_ the force.
  - The work done by a normal or frictional contact force must be determined in each particular case.
  - The work done by the force of gravity, on an object near the surface of Earth, depends only on the weight of the object and the difference in height through which it moved.
  - The work done by a spring force, acting from an initial position to a final position, depends only on the spring constant and the squares of those positions.

#### 7.2 Kinetic Energy

  - The kinetic energy of a particle is the product of one-half its mass and the square of its speed, for non-relativistic speeds.
  - The kinetic energy of a system is the sum of the kinetic energies of all the particles in the system.
  - Kinetic energy is relative to a frame of reference, is always positive, and is sometimes given special names for different types of motion.

#### 7.3 Work-Energy Theorem

  - Because the net force on a particle is equal to its mass times the derivative of its velocity, the integral for the net work done on the particle is equal to the change in the particle’s kinetic energy. This is the work-energy theorem.
  - You can use the work-energy theorem to find certain properties of a system, without having to solve the differential equation for Newton’s second law.

#### 7.4 Power

  - Power is the rate of doing work; that is, the derivative of work with respect to time.
  - Alternatively, the work done, during a time interval, is the integral of the power supplied over the time interval.
  - The power delivered by a force, acting on a moving particle, is the dot product of the force and the particle’s velocity.

However, its spring constant varies over its stretch [see Menz, P.G. “The Physics of Bungee Jumping.” _The Physics Teacher_ (November 1993) 31: 483-487]. Take the length of the cord to be along the _x_-direction and define the stretch _x_ as the length of the cord _l_ minus its un-stretched length l0; that is, x=l−l0 (see below). Suppose a particular bungee cord has a spring constant, for 0≤x≤4.88m, of k1=204N/m and for 4.88m≤x, of k2=111N/m. (Recall that the spring constant is the slope of the force _F(x)_ versus its stretch _x_.) (a) What is the tension in the cord when the stretch is 16.7 m (the maximum desired for a given jump)?

A crate of mass 200 kg is to be brought from a site on the ground floor to a third floor apartment. The workers know that they can either use the elevator first, then slide it along the third floor to the apartment, or first slide the crate to another location marked C below, and then take the elevator to the third floor and slide it on the third floor a shorter distance. The trouble is that the third floor is very rough compared to the ground floor. Given that the coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the ground floor is 0.100 and between the crate and the third floor surface is 0.300, find the work needed by the workers for each path shown from _A_ to _E_. Assume that the force the workers need to do is just enough to slide the crate at constant velocity (zero acceleration). _Note:_ The work by the elevator against the force of gravity is not done by the workers.

![The figure shows the three dimensional 30 meter by 10 meter by 10 meter box defined by the paths described in the problem. The starting point A is at the bottom front left corner. Point B is 30 meters to the right of A. Point C is 10 meters behind point B. Point D is 10 meters above point C. Point E is directly above point B and in front of point D. Point F is directly above point A and to the left of point E. Two paths, both starting at A and ending at E, are indicated by arrows. One path starts at A, goes right to B, back to C, up the elevator to D, and forward to E. The other path starts at A, goes up the elevator to F, then to the right to E.][56] [91][57]. 

A hockey puck of mass 0.17 kg is shot across a rough floor with the roughness different at different places, which can be described by a position-dependent coefficient of kinetic friction.

Find the work done by the kinetic frictional force on the hockey puck when it has moved (a) from x=0 to x=2m, and (b) from x=2m to x=4m.

You are driving your car on a straight road with a coefficient of friction between the tires and the road of 0.55. A large piece of debris falls in front of your view and you immediate slam on the brakes, leaving a skid mark of 30.5 m (100-feet) long before coming to a stop.

Shown below is a 40-kg crate that is pushed at constant velocity a distance 8.0 m along a 30° incline by the horizontal force →F. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the incline is μk=0.40. Calculate the work done by (a) the applied force, (b) the frictional force, (c) the gravitational force, and (d) the net force.

The surface of the preceding problem is modified so that the coefficient of kinetic friction is decreased. The same horizontal force is applied to the crate, and after being pushed 8.0 m, its speed is 5.0 m/s. How much work is now done by the force of friction? Assume that the crate starts at rest.

The force _F_(_x_) varies with position, as shown below. Find the work done by this force on a particle as it moves from x=1.0m to x=5.0m.

![This graph shows the function F\(x\) in Newtons as a function of x in meters. F\(x\) is constant at 1.0 N from x = 0 to x=1.0 m. It rises linearly to 5.0 N at x = 2.0 m then decreases linearly to 1.0 N at x = 4.0 m where it then drops instantly to 0 Newtons. F\(x\) then decreases linearly from 0 N at 4.0 m to -4.0 N at x=6.0 m.][64] 102\.

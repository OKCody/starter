### Summary

#### 15.1 Simple Harmonic Motion

  - Periodic motion is a repeating oscillation. The time for one oscillation is the period _T_ and the number of oscillations per unit time is the frequency _f_. These quantities are related by f=1T.
  - Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is oscillatory motion for a system where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement and acts in the direction opposite to the displacement.
  - Maximum displacement is the amplitude _A_. The angular frequency ω, period _T_, and frequency _f_ of a simple harmonic oscillator are given by ω=√km, T=2π√mk,andf=12π√km, where _m_ is the mass of the system and _k_ is the force constant.
  - Displacement as a function of time in SHM is given byx(t)=Acos(2πTt+ϕ)=Acos(ωt+ϕ).
  - The velocity is given by v(t)=−Aωsin(ωt+ϕ)=−vmaxsin(ωt+ϕ),wherevmax=Aω=A√km.
  - The acceleration is a(t)=−Aω2cos(ωt+ϕ)=−amaxcos(ωt+ϕ), where amax=Aω2=Akm.

#### 15.2 Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

  - The simplest type of oscillations are related to systems that can be described by Hooke’s law, _F_ = −_kx_, where _F_ is the restoring force, _x_ is the displacement from equilibrium or deformation, and _k_ is the force constant of the system.
  - Elastic potential energy _U_ stored in the deformation of a system that can be described by Hooke’s law is given byU=12kx2.
  - Energy in the simple harmonic oscillator is shared between elastic potential energy and kinetic energy, with the total being constant:  
ETotal=12mv2+12kx2=12kA2=constant.
  - The magnitude of the velocity as a function of position for the simple harmonic oscillator can be found by using  
|v|=√km(A2−x2).

#### 15.3 Comparing Simple Harmonic Motion and Circular Motion

  - A projection of uniform circular motion undergoes simple harmonic oscillation.
  - Consider a circle with a radius _A_, moving at a constant angular speed ω. A point on the edge of the circle moves at a constant tangential speed of vmax=Aω. The projection of the radius onto the _x_-axis is x(t)=Acos(ωt+ϕ), where (ϕ) is the phase shift. The _x_-component of the tangential velocity is v(t)=−Aωsin(ωt+ϕ).

#### 15.4 Pendulums

  - A mass _m_ suspended by a wire of length _L_ and negligible mass is a simple pendulum and undergoes SHM for amplitudes less than about 15°. The period of a simple pendulum is T=2π√Lg, where _L_ is the length of the string and _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity.
  - The period of a physical pendulum T=2π√ImgL can be found if the moment of inertia is known. The length between the point of rotation and the center of mass is _L_.
  - The period of a torsional pendulum T=2π√Iκ can be found if the moment of inertia and torsion constant are known.

#### 15.5 Damped Oscillations

  - Damped harmonic oscillators have non-conservative forces that dissipate their energy.
  - Critical damping returns the system to equilibrium as fast as possible without overshooting.
  - An underdamped system will oscillate through the equilibrium position.
  - An overdamped system moves more slowly toward equilibrium than one that is critically damped.

#### 15.6 Forced Oscillations

  - A system’s natural frequency is the frequency at which the system oscillates if not affected by driving or damping forces.
  - A periodic force driving a harmonic oscillator at its natural frequency produces resonance. The system is said to resonate.
  - The less damping a system has, the higher the amplitude of the forced oscillations near resonance. The more damping a system has, the broader response it has to varying driving frequencies.

### Conceptual Questions

#### 15.4 Pendulums

12\. 

Pendulum clocks are made to run at the correct rate by adjusting the pendulum’s length. Suppose you move from one city to another where the acceleration due to gravity is slightly greater, taking your pendulum clock with you, will you have to lengthen or shorten the pendulum to keep the correct time, other factors remaining constant? Explain your answer.

[13][7]. 

A pendulum clock works by measuring the period of a pendulum. In the springtime the clock runs with perfect time, but in the summer and winter the length of the pendulum changes. When most materials are heated, they expand. Does the clock run too fast or too slow in the summer? What about the winter?

14\. 

With the use of a phase shift, the position of an object may be modeled as a cosine or sine function. If given the option, which function would you choose? Assuming that the phase shift is zero, what are the initial conditions of function; that is, the initial position, velocity, and acceleration, when using a sine function? How about when a cosine function is used?

Why are soldiers in general ordered to “route step” (walk out of step) across a bridge?

[19][10]. 

Do you think there is any harmonic motion in the physical world that is not damped harmonic motion? Try to make a list of five examples of undamped harmonic motion and damped harmonic motion. Which list was easier to make?

20\. 

Some engineers use sound to diagnose performance problems with car engines. Occasionally, a part of the engine is designed that resonates at the frequency of the engine. The unwanted oscillations can cause noise that irritates the driver or could lead to the part failing prematurely. In one case, a part was located that had a length _L_ made of a material with a mass _M_. What can be done to correct this problem?

(a) The springs of a pickup truck act like a single spring with a force constant of 1.30×105N/m. By how much will the truck be depressed by its maximum load of 1000 kg? (b) If the pickup truck has four identical springs, what is the force constant of each?

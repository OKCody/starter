### Summary

#### 9.1 Linear Momentum

  - The motion of an object depends on its mass as well as its velocity. Momentum is a concept that describes this. It is a useful and powerful concept, both computationally and theoretically. The SI unit for momentum is kg· m/s.

#### 9.2 Impulse and Collisions

  - When a force is applied on an object for some amount of time, the object experiences an impulse.
  - This impulse is equal to the object’s change of momentum.
  - Newton’s second law in terms of momentum states that the net force applied to a system equals the rate of change of the momentum that the force causes.

#### 9.3 Conservation of Linear Momentum

  - The law of conservation of momentum says that the momentum of a closed system is constant in time (conserved).
  - A closed (or isolated) system is defined to be one for which the mass remains constant, and the net external force is zero.
  - The total momentum of a system is conserved _only_ when the system is closed.

#### 9.4 Types of Collisions

  - An elastic collision is one that conserves kinetic energy.
  - An inelastic collision does not conserve kinetic energy.
  - Momentum is conserved regardless of whether or not kinetic energy is conserved.
  - Analysis of kinetic energy changes and conservation of momentum together allow the final velocities to be calculated in terms of initial velocities and masses in one-dimensional, two-body collisions.

#### 9.5 Collisions in Multiple Dimensions

  - The approach to two-dimensional collisions is to choose a convenient coordinate system and break the motion into components along perpendicular axes.
  - Momentum is conserved in both directions simultaneously and independently.
  - The Pythagorean theorem gives the magnitude of the momentum vector using the _x_\- and _y_-components, calculated using conservation of momentum in each direction.

#### 9.6 Center of Mass

  - An extended object (made up of many objects) has a defined position vector called the center of mass.
  - The center of mass can be thought of, loosely, as the average location of the total mass of the object.
  - The center of mass of an object traces out the trajectory dictated by Newton’s second law, due to the net external force.
  - The internal forces within an extended object cannot alter the momentum of the extended object as a whole.

#### 9.7 Rocket Propulsion

  - A rocket is an example of conservation of momentum where the mass of the system is not constant, since the rocket ejects fuel to provide thrust.
  - The rocket equation gives us the change of velocity that the rocket obtains from burning a mass of fuel that decreases the total rocket mass.

### Challenge Problems

A 65-kg person jumps from the first floor window of a burning building and lands almost vertically on the ground with a horizontal velocity of 3 m/s and vertical velocity of −9m/s. Upon impact with the ground he is brought to rest in a short time. The force experienced by his feet depends on whether he keeps his knees stiff or bends them. Find the force on his feet in each case.

  1. First find the impulse on the person from the impact on the ground. Calculate both its magnitude and direction.
  2. Find the average force on the feet if the person keeps his leg stiff and straight and his center of mass drops by only 1 cm vertically and 1 cm horizontally during the impact.
  3. Find the average force on the feet if the person bends his legs throughout the impact so that his center of mass drops by 50 cm vertically and 5 cm horizontally during the impact.

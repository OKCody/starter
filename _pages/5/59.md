### Summary

#### 8.1 Potential Energy of a System

  - For a single-particle system, the difference of potential energy is the opposite of the work done by the forces acting on the particle as it moves from one position to another.
  - Since only differences of potential energy are physically meaningful, the zero of the potential energy function can be chosen at a convenient location.
  - The potential energies for Earth’s constant gravity, near its surface, and for a Hooke’s law force are linear and quadratic functions of position, respectively.

#### 8.2 Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces

  - A conservative force is one for which the work done is independent of path. Equivalently, a force is conservative if the work done over any closed path is zero.
  - A non-conservative force is one for which the work done depends on the path.
  - For a conservative force, the infinitesimal work is an exact differential. This implies conditions on the derivatives of the force’s components.
  - The component of a conservative force, in a particular direction, equals the negative of the derivative of the potential energy for that force, with respect to a displacement in that direction.

#### 8.3 Conservation of Energy

  - A conserved quantity is a physical property that stays constant regardless of the path taken.
  - A form of the work-energy theorem says that the change in the mechanical energy of a particle equals the work done on it by non-conservative forces.
  - If non-conservative forces do no work and there are no external forces, the mechanical energy of a particle stays constant. This is a statement of the conservation of mechanical energy and there is no change in the total mechanical energy.
  - For one-dimensional particle motion, in which the mechanical energy is constant and the potential energy is known, the particle’s position, as a function of time, can be found by evaluating an integral that is derived from the conservation of mechanical energy.

#### 8.4 Potential Energy Diagrams and Stability

  - Interpreting a one-dimensional potential energy diagram allows you to obtain qualitative, and some quantitative, information about the motion of a particle.
  - At a turning point, the potential energy equals the mechanical energy and the kinetic energy is zero, indicating that the direction of the velocity reverses there.
  - The negative of the slope of the potential energy curve, for a particle, equals the one-dimensional component of the conservative force on the particle. At an equilibrium point, the slope is zero and is a stable (unstable) equilibrium for a potential energy minimum (maximum).

#### 8.5 Sources of Energy

  - Energy can be transferred from one system to another and transformed or converted from one type into another. Some of the basic types of energy are kinetic, potential, thermal, and electromagnetic.
  - Renewable energy sources are those that are replenished by ongoing natural processes, over human time scales. Examples are wind, water, geothermal, and solar power.
  - Non-renewable energy sources are those that are depleted by consumption, over human time scales. Examples are fossil fuel and nuclear power.

A mysterious force acts on all particles along a particular line and always points towards a particular point _P_ on the line. The magnitude of the force on a particle increases as the cube of the distance from that point; that is F∞r3F∞r3, if the distance from _P_ to the position of the particle is _r_. Let _b_ be the proportionality constant, and write the magnitude of the force as F=br3F=br3. Find the potential energy of a particle subjected to this force when the particle is at a distance _D_ from _P_, assuming the potential energy to be zero when the particle is at _P_.

A skier starts from rest and slides downhill. What will be the speed of the skier if he drops by 20 meters in vertical height? Ignore any air resistance (which will, in reality, be quite a lot), and any friction between the skis and the snow.

[81][68]. 

Repeat the preceding problem, but this time, suppose that the work done by air resistance cannot be ignored. Let the work done by the air resistance when the skier goes from _A_ to _B_ along the given hilly path be −2000 J. The work done by air resistance is negative since the air resistance acts in the opposite direction to the displacement. Supposing the mass of the skier is 50 kg, what is the speed of the skier at point _B_?

In an amusement park, a car rolls in a track as shown below. Find the speed of the car at _A_, _B_, and _C_. Note that the work done by the rolling friction is zero since the displacement of the point at which the rolling friction acts on the tires is momentarily at rest and therefore has a zero displacement.

The car starts with v = 0 at the top of the first hill. Point A is the low point between the second and third hill, 20 meters above the ground. Point B is at the top of the third hill, 40 meters above the ground. Point C is at the ground near the end of the track.][70] 84\.

### Summary

#### 12.1 Conditions for Static Equilibrium

  - A body is in equilibrium when it remains either in uniform motion (both translational and rotational) or at rest. When a body in a selected inertial frame of reference neither rotates nor moves in translational motion, we say the body is in static equilibrium in this frame of reference.
  - Conditions for equilibrium require that the sum of all external forces acting on the body is zero (first condition of equilibrium), and the sum of all external torques from external forces is zero (second condition of equilibrium). These two conditions must be simultaneously satisfied in equilibrium. If one of them is not satisfied, the body is not in equilibrium.
  - The free-body diagram for a body is a useful tool that allows us to count correctly all contributions from all external forces and torques acting on the body. Free-body diagrams for the equilibrium of an extended rigid body must indicate a pivot point and lever arms of acting forces with respect to the pivot.

#### 12.2 Examples of Static Equilibrium

  - A variety of engineering problems can be solved by applying equilibrium conditions for rigid bodies.
  - In applications, identify all forces that act on a rigid body and note their lever arms in rotation about a chosen rotation axis. Construct a free-body diagram for the body. Net external forces and torques can be clearly identified from a correctly constructed free-body diagram. In this way, you can set up the first equilibrium condition for forces and the second equilibrium condition for torques.
  - In setting up equilibrium conditions, we are free to adopt any inertial frame of reference and any position of the pivot point. All choices lead to one answer. However, some choices can make the process of finding the solution unduly complicated. We reach the same answer no matter what choices we make. The only way to master this skill is to practice.

#### 12.3 Stress, Strain, and Elastic Modulus

  - External forces on an object (or medium) cause its deformation, which is a change in its size and shape. The strength of the forces that cause deformation is expressed by stress, which in SI units is measured in the unit of pressure (pascal). The extent of deformation under stress is expressed by strain, which is dimensionless.
  - For a small stress, the relation between stress and strain is linear. The elastic modulus is the proportionality constant in this linear relation.
  - Tensile (or compressive) strain is the response of an object or medium to tensile (or compressive) stress. Here, the elastic modulus is called Young’s modulus. Tensile (or compressive) stress causes elongation (or shortening) of the object or medium and is due to an external forces acting along only one direction perpendicular to the cross-section.
  - Bulk strain is the response of an object or medium to bulk stress. Here, the elastic modulus is called the bulk modulus. Bulk stress causes a change in the volume of the object or medium and is caused by forces acting on the body from all directions, perpendicular to its surface. Compressibility of an object or medium is the reciprocal of its bulk modulus.
  - Shear strain is the deformation of an object or medium under shear stress. The shear modulus is the elastic modulus in this case. Shear stress is caused by forces acting along the object’s two parallel surfaces.

#### 12.4 Elasticity and Plasticity

  - An object or material is elastic if it comes back to its original shape and size when the stress vanishes. In elastic deformations with stress values lower than the proportionality limit, stress is proportional to strain. When stress goes beyond the proportionality limit, the deformation is still elastic but nonlinear up to the elasticity limit.
  - An object or material has plastic behavior when stress is larger than the elastic limit. In the plastic region, the object or material does not come back to its original size or shape when stress vanishes but acquires a permanent deformation. Plastic behavior ends at the breaking point.

When a motor is set on a pivoted mount seen below, its weight can be used to maintain tension in the drive belt. When the motor is not running the tensions T1 and T2 are equal. The total mass of the platform and the motor is 100.0 kg, and the diameter of the drive belt pulley is 16.0cm. when the motor is off, find: (a) the tension in the belt, and (b) the force at the hinged platform support at point _C_. Assume that the center of mass of the motor plus platform is at the center of the motor.

![Figure shows a motor set on a pivoted mount. The center of the motor is 25 cm above and 30 cm to the right from the support point C. Tension T1 forms a 40 degree angle with the line parallel to the ground. Tension T2 forms a 15 degree angle with the line parallel to the ground.][59] [77][60]. 

Two wheels _A_ and _B_ with weights _w_ and 2_w_, respectively, are connected by a uniform rod with weight _w_/2, as shown below. The wheels are free to roll on the sloped surfaces. Determine the angle that the rod forms with the horizontal when the system is in equilibrium. _Hint:_ There are five forces acting on the rod, which is two weights of the wheels, two normal reaction forces at points where the wheels make contacts with the wedge, and the weight of the rod.

![Figure shows the wheels A and B connected by the rod and located at the opposite side of the right angle triangle. Side at which wheel A is located forms a 60 degree angle with the line parallel to the ground. Side at which wheel B is located forms a 30 degree angle with the line parallel to the ground.][61] 78\. 

Weights are gradually added to a pan until a wheel of mass _M_ and radius _R_ is pulled over an obstacle of height _d_, as shown below. What is the minimum mass of the weights plus the pan needed to accomplish this?
